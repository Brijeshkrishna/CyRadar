Uginq8YLwpEjiHgCoAEC;2016-07-15T07:27:55Z;"Hey @Savjee, thank you for this video it helps me a loth!
I'm just wondering is it possible to make some command for Push on the server?
For example, i don't want that bitbucket push files on the FTP server every time that i commit. So is it possible to make something like commitName[command for push] and that command to be trigger for pushing?";OldArchive;0;
Uginq8YLwpEjiHgCoAEC.8GLQeGZ84A18GLSyC1qT8c;2016-07-15T07:48:06Z;"I think your question is: how can I push to FTP when I want it (on certain commit).
The answers is: use branches. Create a branch ""dev"" and commit as many times as you want in it. Then once you're finished, you can merge your dev branch into the master branch to let BitBucket deploy it.

Check out the documentation: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/configure-bitbucket-pipelines-yml-792298910.html and read the section ""Mapping your branch workflow in bitbucket-pipelines.yml"". There they show you how you can run BitBucket Pipelines only for certain branches. So may choose to only use Pipelines on your master branch, not on your dev branch.

I think that will help you ;)";Simply Explained;0;
Uginq8YLwpEjiHgCoAEC.8GLQeGZ84A18GLTR1axQlN;2016-07-15T07:52:11Z;Yep, exacly what i was searching for :) Thank you again, cheers;OldArchive;0;

Do you have a video how to setup Bitbucket and Jenkins with SSH?";Eugene Shapov;0;
UgilcNG1Q9F1wXgCoAEC.8GMlc0Go2nB8GOpNmjq3ig;2016-07-16T15:10:26Z;"That's probably because you're using a private repository. You need to generate a new SSH key pair, configure Jenkins to use these keys and add these keys to your BitBucket account.

I'll think about creating a video about it, but not right now. I'm working on a new video series.";Simply Explained;0;

It's because I uploaded the file with the extension "".Css"" (note the uppercase C). On OS X you have a case insensitive file system which means that .Css is the same as .css. On S3 however those are two different files. So renaming the file fixes this issue ;)";Simply Explained;1;

UghLnEGwNex-WngCoAEC.8H1YGNGAezU8H1dpxb4j-f;2016-08-01T11:38:25Z;"Sure! Start by generating a new SSH private and public key. Look around on the internet, you'll definitely find some tutorials on this. Then, in Jenkins, go to your project and find the section ""Source Code Management"". There you find the url to git repository. Under the URL you'll also find ""Credentials"". Click on the add button and add a ""SSH Username with private key"". You can choose a random username and then paste your private key into the ""Private Key"" field. Save the settings in Jenkins.

Now go to the settings of your BitBucket project and go to ""Deployment keys"". Click ""Add key"", give it any label and paste your public key into the field. Now everything should be working!";Simply Explained;1;

1. ""exec php"" is not a valid terminal command under linux. It is just ""php script_name.php""
2. You cannot execute a PHP script that is on a remote server. You have to download it first! You can use CURL or Wget for that, so make sure that you install them in the container that BitBucket pipelines creates.

By default s3_website uses one of the US regions endpoints. If your bucket is in another region you have to add that to do s3_website.yml file. For example: my bucket is in the Ireland region (eu-west-1) so my config file contains this line:

s3_endpoint: eu-west-1

UghDSYu7DnrmY3gCoAEC.8JaXO0HjXgZ8JavjZEUQdv;2016-10-04T06:50:16Z;Sure, you could use Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) to send out email. Just as with DynamoDB you can use its API to integrate with it and send email.;Simply Explained;0;
UghlIZchNfrY8HgCoAEC.8J_SU-k4fUf8JawYTQtIAt;2016-10-04T06:57:22Z;Unfortunately I don't have any experience with Python. However, if you are running the local version of DynamoDB you don't have to worry about IAM. Any request that you make to your local DynamoDB instance will be allowed and you can use fake credentials.;Simply Explained;0;

Is your Debian 'image' publicly available? I presume this allows the '.yml' file to understand the script commands?;Charles Robertson;0;
Ugj7b5WFQVJzAngCoAEC;2016-10-15T04:15:13Z;"Thanks for the video! 
I was wondering about config ""environment-dependent"" files such as wp-config.php on Wordpress or config/app.php on CakePHP. How would you treat them? I think you should ignore them in .gitignore (obviously), but how could we upload them to server? 
The way I see it, maybe we could have a separated folder on our server, let's say: /config_files/ and put the config files there by a different upload process. And our main pipeline could copy the files from this folder to their right place in the project after each deployment.
Is there a better (simpler or safer) way?";Jo√£o Gabriel N. Vieira;0;
Ugj7b5WFQVJzAngCoAEC.8K1yjUhXrwy8K2HZIhlX9y;2016-10-15T07:08:27Z;I usually don't commit these config files to the git repository. I upload them once on the server manually. I'm sure there are better ways to do this but I haven't had the time yet to investigate that.;Simply Explained;0;

Ugg6O1vvqi0YAXgCoAEC.8K6NdkT41WO8K7V-WOpGnr;2016-10-17T07:42:06Z;You can use it to deploy almost anything. Pipelines is build around Docker containers. So if your deploy software can run inside a container, you can use Pipelines. I have deployed Laravel applications to FTP servers without problems (using git-ftp).

UgjjCyCP2Tsxa3gCoAEC;2016-10-21T14:14:37Z;Awesome video series, especially the FTP. Do you have any expertise in deploying a rails application? And could you explain what exactly happens when using pipelines? As far as I understand, a docker container is a simple and lightweight layer atop of the OS (let's say, it's Ubuntu). So when I run the pipeline somewhere in the deep web a new container gets created for my build. Then, bitbucket pushes all my code into that container. Then it runs all those commands, which I can specify. Is it somewhat correct?;Anton Kostin;0;
UgjjCyCP2Tsxa3gCoAEC.8KIV5pOejc18KIWZYL3QbH;2016-10-21T14:27:24Z;"No I don't have any experience with deploying rails applications. But that should not hold you back. The rails community has a lot of build and deployment tools (like Capistrano). There is a lot of stuff written about this. GitHub has a blog post detailing how they handle deployments for example.

The flow of pipelines is indeed how you describe it. BitBucket starts a new container for your build. A container is like a very lightweight virtual machine that isolates everything you do. It doesn't run in ""the deep web"", but simply on one of the Atlassian servers. Also BitBucket does not ""push"" your code into a container. They simply instruct the container to do a git pull.";Simply Explained;0;

UghgQrefwJH-GHgCoAEC.8KVkF42tyxv8KVq-LhwPxp;2016-10-26T18:36:05Z;"1) Hmm difficult question, there isn't really a best practice for this. Look around on the internet and you'll find success stories about breaking large applications into small functions, but you'll also find stories about how they grouped together functions into bigger functions. Check out this blog post for example: https://blog.cloudsploit.com/we-made-the-whole-company-serverless-5a91c27cd8c4 here they create 1 big Lambda function with multiple controllers in it and put a simple router in front of it.

2) Amazon only offers scheduled Lambda functions through CloudWatch. You could of course also trigger a Lambda function through the AWS API's or you could put API Gateway in front of your function and call that HTTP endpoint through a web service. It's up to you.";Simply Explained;1;

Google Cloud Functions is still in alpha and only support functions written in Javascript. Azure functions seems much more versatile because it supports PHP, C#, Javascript as well as Bash, Powershell and Batch scripts. Azure functions also make it very easy to add a HTTP endpoint to your function, while with Lambda you have to use API Gateway (which is more complicated but also more flexible).";Simply Explained;1;

Secondly, you can use API keys to restrict access to your API but you can also write a custom authorizer. Take a look at both of them and decide which one serves you better. With a custom authorizer you can (for example) allow people to login with their Facebook or Google accounts and you can verify their tokens before they can hit any of your resources.

I had trouble getting this to work with a large CMS that was already on the server... 

To sort this you use ""catchup"" rather than ""init"". This means it simply catches up to the latest commit - without having to upload the many files in your CMS (wordpress, Joomla etc).

Just thought I'd get it out there! :)

Routing domain from GoDaddy to AWS: there are a lot of tutorials for that. It's just creating a new A record in your DNS settings and pointing it to the IP address of your EC2 instance.

Uggo5innvb0ViHgCoAEC;2016-12-19T14:03:19Z;"Hi,

Can you cover how to do video transcoding using AWS Lambda?

Example:

1. User upload a video into Bucket A
2. Lambda listen for that S3 PUT object event
3. Lambda take it, pass it to AWS Elastic Transcoder (ET)
4. ET do the transcoding; converting the source video into multiple formats
5. ET push all converted videos into Bucket B in S3
6. Lambda listen that S3 PUT object event in Bucket B
7. Lambda notify our web app using AWS SNS HTTP API call

I'm really interested to learn this. I've been doing my own research for quite long time. But still don't have confidence to do it before seeing others do it first in front of my eyes.

 Yeah I  can connect to it through ssh.
-- you r right it is being in endless loop. Thanks a lot.
-- I think I can't use IP address (elastic IP from amazon ec2) as the origin domain name, it has to be a domain name. So I am thinking this:
   1.  create a sub domain (e.g. cdn.example.com) as the origin domain name for cloudfront distribution
   2.  In DNS settings: cname: cdn.example.com points to the server ip (@)
   3. In DNS settings: cname: www points to the domain url (xxxx.cloudfront.net) from cloudfront distribution

Your site's SSL works fine. But you installed a certificate from Comodo. That has nothing to do with AWS Certificate Manager and so it's irrelevant for this video. Still nice job on enabling SSL for your site ;)

There are many options available:


1) Upload your files to S3 (many tools available). Let the S3 bucket trigger a Lambda function that reads your new files and puts them into RDS/DynamoDB.


2) You could also write a small script that runs on your computer to directly import the data into DynamoDB/RDS with the SDK. Then you wouldn't need to store in S3 and you don't need a Lambda function.


Either one will work, it just depends on wether you want to keep all the input data in S3 or if having DynamoDB/RDS alone is enough. 


Hope it helps!";Simply Explained;0;

When a Jenkins build is started, Jenkins will download all your source files from your SCM (git, svn, ..). That is by default, you don't need to do anything for that. In other words: your repository will be cloned in a directory on your Jenkins server.

It sounds like you want to upload files to a different server after each build. If that's the case you have to use a tool like git-ftp or lftp to upload your files.";Simply Explained;0;

Not exactly related to your video but can you explain your folder structure/application layout when you are developing an app that uses typescript for both the client and server (node) ? i.e. does the client app 'live'l within a folder inside the server app (i.e. only one package.json) or do you split it out to do completely separate folders (and thus 2 package.json);Wallace Turner;0;

- Separate directories for backend and front-end
- A separate directory for all the ""core"" files that are completely shared between both.

These core files can be included in your front-end and back-end projects by using git submodules or plain symlinks. In the core I keep all my models and everything else that is used by both the front-end and the back-end.

Ugib3HAu5XvM6ngCoAEC.8T18zA4Nbkd8T3trqJk1CN;2017-05-27T14:53:42Z;"My understanding is this. I welcome correction, if I have it wrong though. :-)

SSL on CloudFlare will secure traffic between your site visitor (who hits the CloudFlare CDN, instead of your webserver). However, CloudFlare doesn't natively secure traffic from CloudFlare to your webserver. This setup is Flexible SSL. To have end to end SSL, you need both CloudFlare SSL configured and a cert installed at your host, in this case AWS.

CloudFlare can be configured to do HTTPS rewrites, and attempt strict SSL. Essentially, if it sees that your webserver is calling an asset from http://anything.com/any-asset, CloudFlare will try to rewrite it as httpS://anything.com/any-asset. However, under this setup, if you disable CloudFlare for any reason, your site would be http.

I hope this is helpful.";Bret Carmichael;0;

Thanks for great video! I am new to Jenkins and i am trying to build my own theme with company logo embeeded on it. As you have demonstrated in video i have done and downloaded CSS file. But i am not sure where i need to copy it and what would the URL of theme CSS?

UgiQPIymbL9tdXgCoAEC;2017-06-09T12:37:40Z;"Hi savjee.

I want to start build automatically when i merge code in bit bucket Dev branch to QA branch so i have used ""Build when a change is pushed to Bit Bucket"" in Jenkins and i already set my web book URL in bit bucket. How to start build automatically after only merge.?";Ashish Sharma;0;
UgiQPIymbL9tdXgCoAEC.8Ta7ctZMTn38TaAE2xI4PC;2017-06-09T13:00:21Z;Samething i have done but when i checked webhook->View requests in bit bucked then, It's showing timeout error;Ashish Sharma;0;
UgiQPIymbL9tdXgCoAEC.8Ta7ctZMTn38TaCRtuL1lc;2017-06-09T13:19:43Z;Then something is wrong with your Jenkins installation. You mentioned before that you run Jenkins on your local machine. As I've said before: you cannot use webhooks when your Jenkins installation is on your own machine. BitBucket cannot contact your machine because it's not on the open internet.;Simply Explained;0;

UgiQPIymbL9tdXgCoAEC.8Ta7ctZMTn38TaGHhdkZPE;2017-06-09T13:53:17Z;Yes, you should install Jenkins on a remote machine. I suggest using a VPS provider like DigitalOcean or Amazon Lightsail. Whatever you prefer. Installing Jenkins on these machines is pretty easy, follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXlN-f6Uk64&index=2&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiSaisKr7OnM4Fl7JXCDDcmt;Simply Explained;0;
UggWp4R_yMdn43gCoAEC;2017-06-09T19:48:44Z;In your other videos, you've used Apex to deploy. I'm sure there are tons of other frameworks out there that handle deployment. Can you talk about all the frameworks out there (serverless, apex, others) and rate their pros/cons?;Todd Behunin;3;
UggAOQSmKF7m5ngCoAEC;2017-06-09T20:15:16Z;Great video series! One thing I would like to see are best practices for designing multiple functions (how that structure looks in source code and integrated in API Gateway). Additionally, it feels like with the products/tools Amazon offers, the need to create an Express api app has gone the way of the earth and you should start designing your applications with a CLOUD FIRST approach now. Does that make sense? Where does an Express api app fit in the serverless ecosystem?;Todd Behunin;0;
UggAOQSmKF7m5ngCoAEC.8Tax-RIXf3c8Tb22ZPwgVu;2017-06-09T21:08:07Z;"That is an interesting idea! I'll definitely make a video in the future that shows how to structure your project for multiple functions. But basically it's as simple as adding them to the serverless.yml file.

Express is indeed not so relevant if you're using Lambda. API Gateway largely replaces the functionalities of Express.";Simply Explained;2;
UggWp4R_yMdn43gCoAEC.8Taty7r_WLR8Tb2bSLSIGZ;2017-06-09T21:13:01Z;"Sure! Would like a video about that? In summary: Serverless is the most complete one and also the most robust. Frameworks like Apex make direct API calls to update your functions.



The big strength of Serverless is that it uses CloudFormation to deploy your functions. That means that you get consistency. When something goes wrong during a deployment, CloudFormation will rollback all the changes so that nothing gets deployed. It's an all or nothing situation and this avoids the problem where some of your functions are updated successfully and others failed updating. 


Another strength of Serverless is that you can let it deploy other AWS resources. So let's say that your app needs some Lambda functions, an S3 bucket, some DynamoDB tables, ... Well you can define all of that in the serverless.yml file and it will deploy everything for you. If you ever need to move to another AWS account -> simply redeploy and your entire infrastructure will be ready for you.


Oh and don't forget that Serverless has support for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and IBM's cloud!";Simply Explained;7;
UggAOQSmKF7m5ngCoAEC.8Tax-RIXf3c8Tb8ScQjWjO;2017-06-09T22:04:07Z;Thank you for confirming that Express isn't really relevant in the Lambda world. I've been trying to find that confirmation everywhere but no one's really said that. There are node packages to lift an Express app up to Lambda, but little is said on what the best practices are going forward i.e. that, once you're whole Express app is on Lambda, you should then migrate all your endpoints over to individual lambda functions, etc.;Todd Behunin;0;
Ugim9jGgUCnK83gCoAEC;2017-06-11T19:44:33Z;"so i have a certificate that is issued and in use. I have created a cloudfront distribution and set the origin as my domain and linked the certificate to the distribution. All fine so far.

Then I need to add alias to my domain. So I created https.mydomain.no and added the cloudfront distribution domain. However i get a server error when i try to access the https address. I'm sure my error here is with DNS but I don't know what i'm doing wrong. 

I didn't set up the domain with Amazon so i'm not sure how it's stored. It doesn't seem to be a S3 bucket. But i see the address is a hosted zone. I'm new to AWS and have no clue how to fix this. 

Any help greatly appreciated.";Craig Sapsford Solsvik;0;

As far as I can tell you're not using CloudFront for your website.


Basically you need to:
* Create CloudFront distribution and set your server as the origin. Note that you cannot use your domain as origin! Try to use your server IP or create a dedicated subdomain for your server (eg. server.domain.com).

I hope you solved your problem by now.


It's always DNS! Just kidding. Do you really want to use https.domain.com as your HTTPS endpoint? If not, this is what I would do:


* Create a subdomain that points directly to your server. Eg: server.mydomain.com points to it's IP address.
* Setup CloudFront and use that subdomain as your origin (or you can skip the subdomain and just use the IP address).
* Once everything is done, create a ""www.domain.com"" CNAME record that points to your CloudFront distribution.

UghDH3_azmQfengCoAEC.8R_yjDwHTrr8Us_LMvfeaD;2017-07-11T13:06:16Z;"The title of this series is ""Getting started with AWS Lambda"" and that's exactly what it is. This means you have to have at least some basic knowledge about programming languages, NoSQL database concepts etc. If you're totally new to web development, no wonder you it's useless for you. But there's just no ""easy and quick"" way to get a grasp of it, you have to know the basics. It's like asking: could you teach me how to write games but without that all programming language nonsense?

My opinion on the series:
I had no idea how to start with AWS lambda. Moreover, the official AWS is lacking a quick introduction into the Lambda stuff. After completing this course I'm actually able to create a small real-life application like a very simple blog or a ""to-do"" application using Lambdas, Api Gateway and DynamoDB. So, definitely the author wasn't talking only to himself :) And for that I'd like to thank you, Savjee.";SonicHomicide;3;

UgjrR2IECL8KGngCoAEC.8UkzM5mh03-8UtJV6pfzst;2017-07-11T19:58:18Z;"You can, but it's rather difficult. GitHub needs a way to access your local Jenkins machine. However your modem/router will prevent that from happening (NAT). It's also likely that you have a dynamic IP address that changes every so often. So to make it all work you need 1) to configure port forwarding on your router and 2) a fixed IP address or a service that automatically links a domain name to your dynamic IP (like DynDNS, ..).


It's not that easy to set up, and it's pretty fragile. Consider renting a cheap VPS somewhere and running Jenkins from that.";Simply Explained;4;
UggYO0hWqgCMmHgCoAEC.8UiSXToxIHL8UtJZfDSk6V;2017-07-11T19:58:55Z;Sure you could do that! But then you'll need a CI tool like Jenkins, BitBucket Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline, ...;Simply Explained;0;
Ugg39PkHXpb86XgCoAEC.8UhAIjnLOG-8UtJtHfIMVl;2017-07-11T20:01:44Z;"Great question! I should make a video about this.
Basically you should put all of your logic that works with AWS services in different files (and different classes). When your function starts, you should ""bootstrap"" it and give it a reference to all these files. In this ""bootstrap"" step you can detect if you're running locally and pass along mock objects instead.


The Serverless framework has a simple example here: https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/testing/

U may also be able to get some grant money from IOTA for making the video, as they have a developer/marketing fund: http://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/05/17/iota-announces-2-million-iota-ecosystem-fund/";AC Withcat;0;

                Below is my config file (I have removed all the other commented sections). I am trying to add an api gateway api, lamba function and a dynamoDB table. Everything gets created when I do ""sls deploy"" except for the api. I tried every possible variations for the indentation in the -http section. Nothing worked. Currently I have four space indentation for both path and method. ( I have tried variations like no space, 2 spaces etc). Do I need any special permission to create an api? I used the key/secret as you showed in the earlier video (for my root aws a/c).

One thing I don't understand though is how you would now allow others to make use of this blockchain.

Coming from a web background my first instinct tells me that you need to host this somewhere in order for other people to make use of it.
However, I've heard a lot about decentralization with regards to this technology so that can't be it. Is this where the Bitcoin protocol / P2P decentralized networks come into play?

Also, a video on how to implement your own smart contracts would be awesome as well.";Afterburn;3;

Yes, in order for others to be able to use this blockchain, it would need a P2P network. Each node that has to announce itself on the network and find the longest valid chain available. Once that is found, the node needs to copy the entire chain and then he can start using it.


It also needs a broadcast system for new blocks. As soon as a node mined a new block it should broadcast this to the entire network so others can add that block to their own chain and keep the consensus.

UgzFQhZ3J9f4JA7T1nt4AaABAg;2017-11-02T10:25:13Z;"Great tutorial, thank you. 

I was ""playing"" with your code and i've just discovered that changing the ""Genesis block"" (block 0) attributes is possible (the chain stays valid). This is due to the ""isChainValid()"" method; as you can see, the method has a ""for(var i = 1; i < this.chain.length; i++){ [...]"" which starts from ""i = 1"". This means that no controls are applied to the first block (data can be changed without any problem).

A simple work-around is to change the ""for([..])"" loop (make it starts from ""i=0"" and check the previous block only ""if(i>0)"").

Thanks for your time and knowledge";maurizio maisto;0;

I have a private repository on BitBucket. And all my folders are placed in the root directory of BitBucket. But Jenkins expect all the code to be placed in a folder named ""Cartridges"". (I am developing in Demandware).

For reference, the error is as below:
[+] Copying cartridges
 - WARNING: Invalid dependency folder structure for master! ""cartridges"" folder was not found. (skipped)
 - WARNING: Invalid dependency folder structure for master@tmp! ""cartridges"" folder was not found. (skipped)

2. Is there any better solution? Like can I configure the source path in Jenkins (to read directly from the root of BitBucket) ?

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks";Basit Junaid Afzal;0;

  Thanks for sharing your experience with us.
  I have a few questions for you:
  At 6:00,  when you specified the Jenkins server (http://188.266.139.110:8080) then you specified the ""github-webhook""  server. but you did not mention that the github-webhook is a separate server which is NOT part of the plug-ins that you showed in the video.  I looked it up on the web and was able to download and install it on my machine using CLI ""npm install github-webhook"".  Some warning messages, but I guess it was ok. .... at this point I am stuck :-).  I don't know where all the download files were installed and I don not know how to put them under that Apache Tomcat server where my Jenkins was hosted.
  Would you please help to guide me through the steps?  And here is what I have setup so far:
  1 - Apache-Tomcat server.
  2 - Jenkins is hosted on the Apache-Tomcat under folder ""webapp"".
      all is working fine. I was able to set up auto build based on the Push activity from Jenkins to my GitHub.
      But now I want to set up the post-receive Push notification from GitHUb as you have done.
      Please walk thru the steps on ow to setup the ""github-webhook"".

Because otherwise spammer can improve his computing power and discriminate chain. If it should be increased with each mined block, then how should it be increased? SHA256 outputs fixed-length hashes, so eventually if we will increase difficulty by adding '0' to difficulty criteria, then at one moment we will reach the point, where SHA256 must generate hash with all zeros in it. Or is difficulty something every developer can design by himself?;pipchenko;0;

UgyPFIh90HXIaF8G7GN4AaABAg.8_LB0_hzy7q8_TCIqKgDGG;2017-11-27T10:24:19Z;"No, the difficulty should not be increased after every new block. The difficulty is recalculated after 2016 blocks.


In Bitcoins case, the difficulty is adjusted so that mining a new block takes about 10 minutes. So to mine 2016 blocks, you'll need about 2 weeks. If the network has mined more than 2016 blocks in 2 weeks time, they are going too fast and the difficulty is increased. If the network mined less, then it takes too long and the difficulty is being decreased. 



So it all depends on how fast the miners in the network are.";Simply Explained;7;

Let's assume that there is a company offering a natural disaster insurance. And let's also assume that the government publishes data about these natural disasters on a blockchain somewhere. Then you can make a contract that accepts a monthly fee from you and automatically pays out a fixed amount of money if a real natural disaster happened (and the government added it). A bit difficult and not all types of insurances are fit to be handled through a smart contract. 



A better example: insurance for losing your phone. The smart contract could be triggered if you put your phone into ""lost mode"" or if you file a claim with the police.

Secondly, i have got a doubt. As you were trying to demonstrate the use case of tampering the blockchain by modifying the data of the block or even the hash value was recomputed for that tampered block, you validation API was catching it. However, if had adjusted the previous hash value of the next block in the chain to match the modified block, then the integrity would have lost and still validating API would have passed the chain. Isn't it?";Darshan L.;0;
UgyX4OwCVe0lAdpSLD14AaABAg.8__lu-t_nti8__oDJM2ZAJ;2017-11-30T09:19:02Z;"Yes, you can still tamper with this very simple blockchain. Which is why in the next video I implement the proof-of-work mechanism.

It's interesting to note that you will always be able to tamper with blockchains. However blockchains use a P2P network to create consensus and they have proof-of-work. Proof-of-work means that it takes about 10 minutes to create a new block. If you tamper with one block it will take you at least 10 minutes to re-mine the block (and you have to do this for every following block).

So by the time you fully tampered with all blocks, the other people in the P2P network have already added many new blocks. Watch my ""Simply explained"" video on Blockchains and you'll see ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4&t=93s";Simply Explained;0;

Ugyb1YLX1D4LJ6yDcx14AaABAg;2017-12-12T08:58:38Z;Blockchain is not as decentralized as one may think. Just like how the Internet in theory is not centralized, but people are fighting for net neutrality because approximately 4 ISPs controls the Internet traffic and can change how they handle people's network speeds. Coinbase is going to be the Comcast of currency if we decide cryptos are the way to go.;BRBallin1;0;

Ugyb1YLX1D4LJ6yDcx14AaABAg.8a3fQNsmCqe8a3rgr2LDSa;2017-12-12T10:45:52Z;Yes, there is some truth to your statement. Technically blockchains are decentralized and everyone who joins the network gets the same right. Coinbase is not  a big threat to the decentralized nature, the miners are! Miners create new blocks and validate transactions. Without them, many currencies would be dead. So this gives miners a lot of power. They can dictate the evolution of a cryptocurrency. It's already happening to Bitcoin. Miners reject new features because they could compromise their revenue.;Simply Explained;0;

Ugy6pOxkZ36tEgyxMl14AaABAg;2017-12-13T23:08:34Z;I'm 2/3 in bitcoin, and 1/3 in IOTA now. The problem with lightning network is that you're putting money in escrow with centralized banks that also have relationships with the merchants. Committing the transactions to the blockchain still relies on mining and transaction incentives to keep the network alive, but if people are avoiding the blockchain then it will fall apart. In terms of technology, IOTA is the front-running currency that relies on multi-threading and user participation to verify and base their own transactions on top of valid paths, so that they'll be accepted by others in the network. It's all really complicated, and hopefully well start seeing better explanations in the near future;neaumusic;0;

Increasing the block size also only gives a little scalability while making the issue even worse in the future.
Bitcoin experienced centralization due to the Asic miners along with them abusing the system such as mining empty blocks. Segwit fixed this and is giving Bitcoin many decentralizing scaling solutions like lightning, none of which is any less secure because they still transact on the blockchain. Lightning will increase security by incentivising people to run nodes hence decentralizing Bitcoin even more, then after this there are plans to increase the blocksize safely because it will not give the miners so much power. It was the community that had to fight to get Segwit activated on Bitcoin.
Bcash has increased scalability a little at the cost of becoming less secure due to centralizing to the miners. Bcash scaling vs Bitcoin with full Segwit adoption alone would have only scaled up a little in comparison. Also it does not matter how high you increase the blocksize it will never give you instant transactions, cryptos will need instant transactions in order to survive in the future.";Will Nielsen;1;

Ugztq5PJQPS7NyCFgBp4AaABAg.8a6mCij7nIS8a7zqF2mv6P;2017-12-14T01:14:01Z;"No that is incorrect. This Blockstream conpsiracy is a brainwashing technique Bcash users have been using to attack Bitcoins scaling solutions with incorrect information.
Blockstream has only a few developers out of hundreds of people who contribute to Bitcoins development, they would have no more control nor will it benefit them anymore than anyone else in the world by using the lightning network because it is decentralized. Anyone can create a lightning node simple and easy by just downloading a lightning wallet and throwing a little Bitcoin on it. A lighting node will have no more control over the funds that transfer through it than a Bitcoin node would have at making modifications to the blockchain ledger.";Will Nielsen;13;

UgwpI-9i0EXoyUyJ1R94AaABAg;2017-12-14T07:15:13Z;Lightning Network is not going to decentralize Bitcoin, nor is it going to be useful for private payments.  The logic is simple.  Merchants cannot hold channels open on crypto that can fluctuate as much as 50% in a 24 hour period.  They must convert to fiat via a payment processor.  Thus, LN is useless as a mechanism to move transactions off chain and decentralization.  It only makes sense for payment processors.  But if you're going to keep a payment channel open to BitPay, you may as well create an account with BitPay and deposit BTC to pay merchants with.;psychicpain66;0;

Ugz0PePgr5IbUNLQFK54AaABAg.8a7_q4zi3ji8a935wGutjW;2017-12-14T11:10:30Z;For example I have sold something to my friend for 0.5 BTC, these coins are in our channel, and I want to send those BTC to someone else, but they are locked in my friend's channel, so I have to release it, which is another transaction, then open another channel, which is one more transaction, send it, and receiver has to close it again to release funds, that's 3 Blockchain transactions instead of 2;PuL9;1;
Ugz0PePgr5IbUNLQFK54AaABAg.8a7_q4zi3ji8a93tw8qudM;2017-12-14T11:17:27Z;"Just look at these steps

Currently:
1. Receive BTC from friend (1st TX)
2. Send BTC to the shop (2nd TX)

Lightning Network:
1. Open channel with friend (1st TX)
2. Receive coins from friend
3. Close channel with friend (2nd TX)
4. Open channel with someone else (3d TX)
5. Send coins to someone else
6. Close channel with someone else (4th TX)

That is what I have understood, It's fine if you are constantly sending/receiving coins from the same person, but I am not, I am sending my coins to random people / websites, I would not like to have all my coins locked with random people and wait 1-10 days before it's unlocked, that's even longer than sending BTC today.";PuL9;2;

BCH can handle an order of magnitude more throughput right now just because of that one little parameter change (block cap). Without a block cap, miners are free to include more transactions per block. If you cap that size, a fee war to get included in the next block happens and fees go crazy high. The tradeoff is, the BCH blockchain (transaction history) will grow more rapidly... because it gets used more (since it works). BTC devs are willing to sacrifice usability right now to keep their chain smaller. It is an intentional handicap being placed on BTC so they can encourage adoption of lightening network.;Luke Lorenzo;1;

UgwL9e8A78kh3ZucvD94AaABAg.8aEWJ2ZPIqn8aEXp9KGnyE;2017-12-16T14:15:09Z;DGuliev The fingerprint or the hash or the digest is just a number of 256 digits. It is processed by a hash function (SHA-256) in a way that given a set of data the resulting hash will always be the same. Changing even one character of that data would produce a very different hash.;jfl;0;

UgwL9e8A78kh3ZucvD94AaABAg.8aEWJ2ZPIqn8aE_3gi7jJA;2017-12-16T14:34:45Z;DGuliev well it is an information that is meant to verify another information‚Äôs integrity. For example hashes are used to share data (let‚Äôs say a big file) on the internet. For some reason we may don‚Äôt want that file to be altered during the transfer. So before sending the file we pass it in a hash function. This produces a hash/digest we then send along with the file. To verify the file integrity, the receiver passes the the received file in the same hash function and compare the result with the hash that was sent along with the file.;jfl;0;

Ugz703gEUJ5zOMgK_OF4AaABAg;2017-12-17T15:11:50Z;The Lightning Network is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Most everything it aims to accomplish can be achieved with a simple gift card. I know, I used gyft.com and paid with Bitcoin for years. I would buy a week or two worth of Starbucks at a time for example which would be no different than Starbucks accepting Bitcoin. The installed SegWit pretty much to be able to launch the unneeded Lightning Network when a simple blockchain increase would have done the same thing BUT the miners wanted the higher fees. The Lightning Network will eliminate those higher fees when enabled so the miners will be back to square one. My big question is whether or not the risk that the unproven SegWit code was worth the risk. There could be new attack vectors introduced from it and that would be a disaster. All unnecessary IMHO.;Robert Lefebvre;0;

So to justify that $2 coffee you will have to buy hundreds of them without all the fees being more ridiculous than the credit card ones.

Why would anyone use this ridiculous scheme over something like Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA?";olegkikin;8;

UgxbcUOjPgI9GQ3YDX54AaABAg;2017-12-18T17:24:33Z;Your video is good but I don't like the solution to the bottlenecks. It requires trust in another separate network of third parties so it really doesn't solve the scaling issue. I don't believe just because I trusted one node for one transaction that I want to always trust that node for future transactions. Furthermore it lowers the anonymity of transactions because the network needs to remember the relationships of nodes. I fail to see how any of this is better. Am I misunderstanding? Let me know.;Aaron Wermuth;21;

Does Amy have to already exchanged with Bob. The friend analogy is throwing me off. Is it done on previous trades or known contacts or geographic area.

In places where you are on your own or do not know anyone that uses btc can you use the lightning network.

Ugw8As9fSS4oqPHBho54AaABAg;2017-12-24T04:15:55Z;"Chicken and egg problem.

Say that 7 days has passed and Bob still has 0.3 btc. The coffee shop, because it is a business with normal expenses, needs the bitcoin to make salary payments next week. So in order to receive 7 days of payments, the coffee shop must close the payment channel to receive their 0.2 btc. In fact, the coffee shop does this with all customer payment channels each Thursday so that they can pay employees on Friday.  

On day 8, if Bob or any other regular customer wants to buy coffee again with bitcoin, they must open another payment channel. Therefore, for any regulars, they must open a new payment channel each Friday since the coffee shop closes all payment channels each Thursday to collect all the BTC revenue. 

The unknown is how much the transaction fee is to open a payment channel each week. Let's say the LN brings down the bitcoin tx fee to a mere $2 (arbitrary number but just trying to make a point) from the current monstrous $32 fee, I don't think a lot of ppl will want to pay an extra $8 each month just so that they can use crypto to pay for coffee. They will simply stick to credit card to save the extra $8/month. 

Does the scenario seem reasonable? If not, please state why not. Because if it is reasonable that businesses will close all customer payment channels on a weekly basis, a lot of ppl will not use btc (even if the LN fees are pennies) because it doesn't make sense to pay an extra $8/month for coffee. 

Expand this thought to basically all businesses that do not have a lot of extra cashflow. They all must collect btc sales on a regular basis (e.g., weekly). So the same logic applies to all businesses. Why would ppl pay an extra $8/month when they can use credit card (no extra fees  + plus they get 1% back). 

The only thing I can think of is that once the LN gets saturated, it is not necessary for Bob to open a new payment channel each week. Even if the coffee shop closes the payment channel, as long as Bob can find a path across the network via other ppl who are interconnected with the coffee shop, then Bob can piggy back across this path to buy coffee using btc from the coffee shop. But this is a bit the chicken and the egg problem. Until the market gets completely saturated, the practical reality is that Bob will likely have to constantly open new payment channels as the coffee shop (or any other business) closes them each week. So this deters Bob from using the LN.";nanonerd100;0;

In the best case the blocks would fill by just 9M users who would top off their LN channel monthly, and if the channels were closed monthly, then the whole thing could sustain at most 6M users... I don't see how LN is scalable enough. Not to mention, not sure how many would be comfortable moving 1 month worth of btc to a hot LN wallet.;larposan;0;

That block is valid if 1) the node has done the required proof-of-work 2) the transactions inside the block are all valid. If those conditions are met you can broadcast the block to the rest of the network. These nodes will then validate your proof-of-work and if it checks out, add the block to their local copy.;Simply Explained;0;

Each new block is only valid if the calculation to create that block is validated against it and all blocks before it. There can only be one answer and any single small change to the data would make each and every hash value different in each block, so a forged block would need to have the correct calculations for each and every block in the chain.

Now if you're wondering who created the first block in history, that I don't know. It's all based on digital signatures, so you can be sure that the data was/is legit.

First of all: a new block takes about 10minutes of hard work (proof of work). New blocks are created on a steady pace. Secondly: nodes on the bitcoin network always add blocks to the longest chain.

So, if you tamper with one of the blocks, you'll need to redo the proof of work for all following blocks. This takes you at least 10minutes per block but might be longer. So you'll always run behind the rest of nodes (and so they won't accept any changes you send).

The sad part is that Bitcoin Core has had many forks, making eBitcoin, Bitcoin SegwitX2, SegwitX16, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond. Etc.

Thus it must also hold a LARGE amount of bitcoin in order to serve all these people when large sums are transferred.

such a great content. I really value your input and effort to make those videos. Thanks.

Im sorry that I will write a little bit off-topic, but since Im following your channel - I would like to ask you about your opinion.

How can we explain this crazy volume on pair BTC/LTC from yesterday?
BTC - average daily volume 1-2 mln (today it jumped to 7mln)
LTC - average daily volume lately is less than 1mln (today it jumped to 4,7mln)

And the most IMPORTANT is the fact, that almost all that volume is done between those 2. So some huge amount of resources are being moves somewhere.

I have heard that the founder of Litecoin sold out all his coins in december and he claimed to purchase Bitcoin Cash. 
And that is the only huge connection between those two. But I still dont understand what is happening. Both currencies are having all time record high volume, but at the same time both are losing their value and price is steadily dropping.

Any view on this? Please share.";Piotr Leib;0;

They both don't use blockchains and don't have transaction fees.   They have different methods of reaching consensus.  In RaiBlocks, everyone manages their own private ledgers and transact with each other by creating a send transaction and the other party creates a receive transaction.  RaiBlocks uses delegated proof at stake as its consensus algorithm.  This means people vote for representatives.  These representatives only act when there is an issue and conflicting truths.  The representatives resolve these issues and are rewarded.;MemesTV;9;

UgxEHj6vTcxQBUdg8WR4AaABAg.8a6_j4ufcMW8b5rPol-FIO;2018-01-07T01:53:17Z;This is my understanding. Look at the current btc network you submit a transaction(tx) and it goes to the network the network then processes ur tx and you coin ends up at its destination. The issue is there are to many tx to be processed by a slow 7tx/s network so this is where lightning comes into play. You submit your transaction and its taken by the main chain but is then split off to a side chain and multiple txs can happen there and they are not being submitted to the main chain. Once you close that side chain contract all of the activity that occurred is submitted into the main chain as just one tx for a total of two tx instead of 10/20 or 100+ ex's that occurred in that side chain. So the more side chains taking more txs will equal less txs on the main chain to be processed.;Seryoh;1;
UgxEHj6vTcxQBUdg8WR4AaABAg.8a6_j4ufcMW8b5sob_TK7T;2018-01-07T02:05:33Z;"I think I get it. One tx on chain would represent thousands off-chain. Makes sense. I think its a bit of an over-complication, not that it simply will not work. It feels a bit like ""we couldn't make on-chain work, so we're just gonna do it off the main chain"". There is an enormous opportunity cost that comes from waiting years before it becomes a reality. Major merchants have now left BTC and it's going to be harder to get them back. I think paying to open and close channels is not natural compared to a simple Bitcoin transaction and will cost huge amounts of $ in time. In the early days it will be too expensive to open/close channels for the average person to ever do it for a normal purchase. This is why I'm a fan of Bitcoin Cash among other reasons. There are ways to scale on chain that don't create the opportunity cost because it works right now (compression, block size, subchains, etc). LN could even be added to BCH when its ready, but by then it will already be accepted around the world imho. You can say on-chain is not possible, but BCH is doing it. I think it may be a fine solution one day, but that could take another year+ to become real since it requires every software provider to update their software to work in a completely different way. Bitcoin wants to be currency last year, not next year.";Luke Lorenzo;4;

Most of the time,  those sources talk about making money. Fast.
Only a small percentage really appreciates the technology behind cryptocurrency. And takes the time
to firmly review, without having dollars in their eyes. 
I really appreciate the fact you make these informative video's.
I myself am pretty new to cryptocurrency, so I'm really glad I found your Youtube-channel!

Most Youtubers/Video producers talking about crypto's have a referral link.
Most of the time, I feel like ""meh, you don't deserve it"".
They are not making their video to inform or share knowledge, they make a video to make a quick profit.

But if you had a referral link, I would honestly use it. So you could keep making these great video's.

Ugzwf0ezC6UPgY6_0ed4AaABAg;2018-01-09T12:34:52Z;Ethereum is like the railroad and Cardano is like aviation. Why? A little history: Gold was the first (serious) form of money, it became a store of value, something to hodl. Bitcoin same story, but then digitally and more powerful than gold (as in having revolutionary implications). If we compare cryptos with the California Gold Rush and the Transcontinental Railroad back in the 19th century then Bitcoin is gold and Ethereum is the railroad. All the fortune-seeking ICOs are riding that train, many of them will fail, but the railroad flourishes no matter what. Litecoin/Monero etc are like silver and other precious metals and will also be around for a long time. Next step: Cardano, will be like aviation. They are making sure to get their physics right before you can fly reliably. There are almost no other crypto teams out there going about it in a similar scientific way. And once cryptos become quantum-safe we're in space, but that's a ways off.;tellyaddict3;126;

UgxmZvJZsua6JmQXBxx4AaABAg;2018-01-10T00:41:42Z;I have one question. When you open a channel with another party and want to do a transaction does this means that you need to have btc allocated to that multisig channel or the channel just picks it up from your wallet as needed? Because if that is the case, then there will be the need to have lots of btc spread around in the multiple multisig channels that everyone will create.

Savjee uses Node.js in this example (or just Node), thats how he imported the crypto library for Sha256 in the first video (with the help of npm). It is Javascript on the server or on any PC and it's been around for quite some years. Look it up, really awesome, even when not talking about crypto/blockchain. The early Wallets of Bit- and Altcoins were Qt based on C++, then Java and Phython have been done later, but in principle it's the same logic, just slightly different syntax.;Chris was there;0;

Ugyp_pFIWUMQpIoAJ0Z4AaABAg;2018-01-10T11:28:09Z;"A bit of clarification. Bitcoin is layer 1, for scaling we have layer 2 solution -> lightning network. 
Just like LN, bitcoin is going to absorb good ideas from altcoins like smart contracts (lookup rootstock / RSK for bitcoin) and later privacy features and more. 
If you google, you can find articles about how PoS is actually more expensive than PoW.

Most people have no idea about anything crypto-related so I urge everyone to educate themselves.
As a rule of thumb, ICOs are pump and dump / get rich quick schemes that prey on uneducated bystanders who see dollar signs.

A quick BS check is to see if your favourite altcoin, or ICO claims to be:
- Bitcoin killer
- Ethereum killer
- Scaling solution (already solved by Lightning network)
- Blockchain for X (most likely not needed)";Michal Hantl;18;

In my opinion, this seems to be a valid criticism, so one will have to see how they prove themselves in real world transactions.

Ugwy84f7pX9mtCNsa9Z4AaABAg.8bPlLctqepX8bSRSOCtC_t;2018-01-15T20:20:14Z;It will not guarantee. In fact, it is totally random (not really but...) what will come up as the first n characters of the hash. That makes it so difficult to get more number of first characters to be 0. Suppose difficulty was 1, and only alphanumeric characters were allowed in the hash. Then it would take about (26+10) = 36 uniquely starting hash to get one starting with 0. So the probability will be 1/36 which is quite high. If we want two zeroes instead, we need to try about 38^2 uniquely starting digram hashes. Probability of finding such hash = 1/1296 so the probability decreases exponentially with linearly increasing difficulty;Areeb Jamal;0;

Ugyhv-IdRM2Iy3MzMoV4AaABAg.8ado30Fuk8g8bXqRmK5ZUy;2018-01-17T22:43:33Z;The problem is that bitcoin has miners which make the hash rate really high. It would be extremely difficult for someone to achieve even 1% of total network processing power (no, there is no miner with that amount of processing - a pool of miners is not a single miner, it is a *pool* if miners). On IOTA, since there are no miners, it is trivial to reach more than 100% of the total network processing power. Even if IOTA did more transactions per second than VISA, it would not be nearly enough to keep it secure. Before you say companies would keep up servers confirming transacions: they would be doing the miners job, but without the rewards, and still would be much less processing power (no rewards, no incentives).;fbafelipe;1;
UgxFS-fV1R6au6Eyqht4AaABAg.8bI5qPD1b4U8bXqppCGN_X;2018-01-17T22:46:58Z;On IOTA the device making the transacion does the mining. Note that the marketing of this coin is targeted for IoT devices, which in general are low processing power devices. Thats why they have the Coordinator, which is a trusted node, run by IOTA fundation, which prevent double spending. Until they turn off the Coordinator, it is a centralized coin. They say one day they will turn the Coordinator off, but I really doubt that, low processing power devices are not enough to keep the network secure.;fbafelipe;4;

Ugz8_dr_1i6QheU59Lh4AaABAg;2018-01-18T08:18:13Z;"Let's see if I got this. I pay a huge transaction fee to put my bitcoin on the lightning network. If I want to pay some one, they must also be on the network. We'll probably both need to open a channel to a central node (read bank). The node (bank) will transmit my bitcoin from me to my payee & charge a fee (probably to me & the payee, they need to make a profit after all to keep this service running).  I must trust this node not to steal my bitcoin. To avoid the huge Bitcoin transaction fees & keep the blockchain from getting too big, we should keep all our bitcoin on the lightning network, where it will be very very safe (MtGox).  And the software to do this is surprisingly simple & uncomplicated. It's nearly ready to roll out, just a couple of tweeks. And when everyone is on the LN, we can actually decrease the block size & make Bitcoin even safer from centralization. 

So, is this more or less correct? Have I got it? Heck then, what could go wrong?!

To me the lightning network only seems to really work if the channels are just between customers and banks.  A bank of some sort that can put a large sum in that vault (escrow) for the channel open.  And no point in opening a channel unless you plan to send at least 3 transactions through it.  Plus who pays the mining fee on channel close?  The closer?  Does the coffee shop just eat the closing fee?  They could ask the customer to pre-pay the closing fee, but then the customer pays double if they close it.. and how the coffee shop predict what the fee will be in the future.;Ben Pryor;3;
UgwHo2tA0-jBOFkHlwx4AaABAg.8abC0Shkp5j8bmSlntdqS0;2018-01-24T00:15:49Z;Channels only make sense for large pools of BTC and the expectation of lots of transactions (two main block transactions and fees to open/close and btc stuck in escrow while the channel is open).  If you put a bank between bob and the coffee shop (Bob pays bank, bank pays coffee shop) then it makes sense (see credit cards).  The Alice example is really just adding more banks and doing bank to bank transfers.  This would eventually mean the BTC main chain is really just a ledger between banks.;Ben Pryor;1;

If I connect the lambda function with the API through the lambda I got the ""internal server error"" which was solved by making the callback as indicated by Phillip...

callback(null, { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(generatedNumber) });

However, if I connect them through the API Gateway as explained later on the video, I have to use the original's video callback or else it returns {""statusCode"":200,""body"":""8""} 

Any ideia why? Clearly, there's a small difference on both connecting methods which I would like to understand.

UgzBYLsnlDRPDySk0E54AaABAg.8bo_IFkKJ1p8bpt9RmVfcH;2018-01-25T08:12:50Z;"OK, so, turns out when creating the integration from the lambda console, it creates the resource and/or the ANY method on the API gateway using proxy integration, which means, the response should have the format below because the whole headers are being sent to/from lambda through the proxy

{ statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(generatedNumber) }

otherwise, you get an ""Execution failed due to configuration error: Malformed Lambda proxy response"" when testing it from the API Gateway console.

This can be fixed by simply adding a new GET method (without proxy) in the API console to the resource lambda created, however I think the best way to create the integration is from the API Gateway itself instead of straight from lambda to avoid any kind of unknown default configuration lambda might apply.

UgwNnje_ObAPewvzfYh4AaABAg;2018-01-25T20:30:58Z;Since in the video coffee cost 0.005btc each time, and the channel has 0.05btc from bob side, he can only pay for coffee 10 times. After that the payment need to be closed. So the transaction limit is based on how much money you which to stake in the channel, until you decide to open a new channel. There is probably some fees if using hub and most likely fees is going to be in percentage of the amount transact so that very much limit the lightning network use case for small payments ie. microtransaction.;Haliff Roslan;0;

Encryption is a process of taking a message and scrambling its contents 
Âä†ÂØÜÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™ÊääÊ≠£Â∏∏‰ø°ÊÅØÂèòÂæóËÆ©‰∫∫ËØª‰∏çÊáÇÁöÑËøáÁ®ã

that only certain people can look at your message
Âè™Êúâ‰ºöËß£Á†ÅÁöÑ‰∫∫ËÉΩËØªÂèñÂä†ÂØÜ‰ø°ÊÅØ

There are two types of encryption
Áé∞Âú®Êúâ‰∏§ÁßçÂä†ÂØÜÊñπÂºè

symmetric and asymmetric encryption
ÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜÂíåÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜ

Let‚Äôs first take a look at symmetric encryption
Êàë‰ª¨ÂÖàÊù•ÁúãÁúãÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜ

to understand why asymmetric encryption was created
‰πãÂêéÊâçÂ•ΩÁêÜËß£ÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜÁöÑÂº∫Â§ß

To do that, let me introduce you to Alice and Bob
Âí±‰ª¨ÊïÖ‰∫ãÁöÑÂ•≥‰∏ªÊòØAliceÔºåÁî∑‰∏ªÊòØBob

Alice has a sensitive document that she wants to share with bob
ÂÅáËÆæAliceÊÉ≥Âèë‰∏Ä‰ªΩÊïèÊÑüÊñáÊ°£ÁªôBob

She uses an encryption program to protect her document with a password or passphrase that she chooses
Â•πÁî®ËΩØ‰ª∂ÁªôÊñáÊ°£Âä†ÂØÜ

She then sends the encrypted document to Bob
ÁÑ∂ÂêéÂ•πÊääÂä†ÂØÜÂêéÁöÑÊñáÊ°£ÂèëÁªôBob

However, Bob cannot open this message
ÁÑ∂ËÄåBobÊâì‰∏çÂºÄËøô‰ªΩÊñáÊ°£

Because he doesn‚Äôt know the passphrase that Alice used to encrypt the document
Âõ†‰∏∫‰ªñ‰∏çÁü•ÈÅìAliceËÆæÁΩÆÁöÑÂØÜÁ†Å

And other words, he doesn‚Äôt have the key to open the lock
Êç¢Âè•ËØùËØ¥ÔºåBobÊ≤°ÊúâÂºÄÈîÅÁöÑÈí•Âåô

Now comes the real problem
ÈÇ£‰πàÈóÆÈ¢òÊù•‰∫Ü

how does Alice share this passphrase securely with Bob?
AliceÊÄé‰πàÊâçËÉΩÂÆâÂÖ®Âú∞ÊääÂØÜÁ†ÅÂëäËØâBobÂë¢Ôºü

Sending it through email is risky
Áî®ÁîµÂ≠êÈÇÆ‰ª∂ÂèëÈÄÅÂØÜÁ†ÅÂæàÂç±Èô©

because others might find the passphrase
Âõ†‰∏∫ÈªëÂÆ¢ËÉΩËΩªËÄåÊòì‰∏æÁ†¥Ëß£ÂÖ∂‰∏≠ÁöÑÂØÜÁ†Å

and use it to decrypt any messages between Alice and Bob
ÁÑ∂ÂêéAliceÂíåBobÊâÄÊúâÂæÄÊù•ÈÇÆ‰ª∂Â∞±ÂÖ¨‰πã‰∫é‰∏ñ‰∫Ü

This is exactly the kind of problem that asymmetric encryption intends to solve
ËØ•ÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜÁôªÂú∫‰∫ÜÔºÅ

It is comparable to a mailbox on the street
ÂÅáËÆæË°ó‰∏äÊúâ‰∏™ÈÇÆÁÆ±

The mailbox is exposed to anyone who knows its location
ÈÇÆÁÆ±ÁöÑÂú∞ÂùÄÊòØÂØπÊâÄÊúâ‰∫∫ÂÖ¨ÂºÄÁöÑ

We can say that the location of the mailbox is completely public
ÈÇÆÁÆ±ÁöÑÂú∞ÂùÄÊòØÂØπÊâÄÊúâ‰∫∫ÂÖ¨ÂºÄÁöÑ

Anyone who knows the address can go to the mailbox and drop in a letter
Áü•ÈÅìÈÇÆÁÆ±Âú∞ÂùÄÁöÑ‰∫∫ÈÉΩÂèØ‰ª•ËøáÊù•ÊäïÈÄí‰ø°‰ª∂

However, only the owner of the mailbox has a key to open it up and read the messages
‰ΩÜÂè™ÊúâÈÇÆÁÆ±‰∏ª‰∫∫ÊúâÊâìÂºÄÂÆÉÁöÑÈí•Âåô

So let‚Äôs now go back to technical details
ÂõûÂà∞ÊäÄÊúØÂ±ÇÈù¢Êù•Áúã

When using asymmetric encryption
‰ΩøÁî®ÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜÊó∂

both Alice and Bob have to generate a key-pair on their computers
AliceÂíåBobÈúÄÂú®ÂêÑËá™ÁöÑÁîµËÑë‰∏äÁîüÊàê‰∏ÄÂØπÂØÜÈí•

A popular and secure way for doing this is by using the RSA algorism
RSAÁÆóÊ≥ïÊòØ‰∏ÄÁßçÂæàÂèóÊ¨¢Ëøé„ÄÅÂæàÂÆâÂÖ®ÁöÑÂØÜÈí•ÂØπÁîüÊàêÊñπÂºè

This algorism will generate a public and private key
RSAÁÆóÊ≥ï‰ºöÁîüÊàê‰∏Ä‰∏™ÂÖ¨Èí•Âíå‰∏Ä‰∏™ÁßÅÈí•

they are mathematically link to each otherÔºõ
ÂÖ¨Èí•ÂíåÁßÅÈí•‰πãÈó¥Â≠òÂú®ÊüêÁßçÊï∞Â≠¶ÂÖ≥Á≥ªÔºõ

Public keys can be used to encrypt data 
Áî®ÂÖ¨Èí•Âä†ÂØÜÁöÑÊï∞ÊçÆ

and only the matching private key can be used to decrypt it
Âè™Êúâ‰∏éÂÖ∂ÂØπÂ∫îÁöÑÁßÅÈí•ËÉΩËß£ÂºÄ

Even though the keys are linked together
Â∞ΩÁÆ°ÂÖ¨Èí•ÁßÅÈí•ÊòØÂÖ≥ËÅîÁöÑ

they cannot be derived from each other
‰∫∫‰ª¨Êó†Ê≥ïÁî®ÂÖ∂‰∏≠‰∏Ä‰∏™Êé®ÁÆóÂá∫Âè¶‰∏Ä‰∏™

And other words, if you know someone‚Äôs public key
‰πüÂ∞±ÊòØËØ¥ÔºåÂ¶ÇÊûú‰Ω†Áü•ÈÅìÊüê‰∫∫ÁöÑÂÖ¨Èí•

you cannot derive his private key
‰Ω†ÊòØÁÆó‰∏çÂá∫‰ªñÁöÑÁßÅÈí•ÁöÑ

If you retake our mailbox example
Á±ªÊØîË°ó‰∏äÁöÑÈÇÆÁÆ±

That the mailbox‚Äôs address would be the public key
ÈÇÆÁÆ±ÁöÑÁ°ÆÂàáÂú∞ÁêÜ‰ΩçÁΩÆÁ≠âÂêå‰∫éÂÖ¨Èí•

something that everyone is allowed to know
ÊòØÂÖ¨‰πã‰∫é‰ºóÁöÑ

The owner of the mailbox is the only one who has the private key and that is needed to open up the mailbox
ËÄåÂè™ÊúâÈÇÆÁÆ±‰∏ª‰∫∫ÊâçÊã•ÊúâÂèØ‰ª•ÊâìÂºÄÈÇÆÁÆ±ÁöÑÁßÅÈí•

Let‚Äôs now take a look at how Alice and Bob can use asymmetric encryption to communicate securely with each other 
ÂÜçÁúãÁúãAliceÂíåBobÂ¶Ç‰ΩïÁî®ÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜÂÆûÁé∞ÂÆâÂÖ®ÈÄö‰ø°

They start by exchanging their public keys
‰ªñ‰ª¨È¶ñÂÖà‰∫§Êç¢ÂÖ¨Èí•

Bob gives his public key to Alice and Alice gives her public key to Bob
BobÊääËá™Â∑±ÁöÑÂÖ¨Èí•ÁªôAliceÔºåÂèç‰πã‰∫¶ÁÑ∂

Now Alice can send her sensitive document again
Áé∞Âú®AliceÂèëÈÄÅÈÇ£‰ªΩÊïèÊÑüÊñá‰ª∂ÁöÑÊó∂ÂÄô

She takes the document, and encrypts it with Bob‚Äôs public key
Áî®ÁöÑÊòØBobÁöÑÂÖ¨Èí•Êù•ÁªôÊñá‰ª∂Âä†ÂØÜ

She then sends the file to Bob who uses his private key to unlock the document and read it
ÂΩìBobÊî∂Âà∞Êñá‰ª∂ÂêéÔºåÂèØ‰ª•Áî®Ëá™Â∑±ÁöÑÁßÅÈí•Êù•ËØªÂèñÊñá‰ª∂

Because they use asymmetric encryption
Âõ†‰∏∫‰ªñ‰ª¨‰ΩøÁî®ÁöÑÊòØÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜ

only Bob is able to decrypt the message
Âè™ÊúâBobËÉΩËß£ÂºÄÂä†ÂØÜÊñá‰ª∂

Not even Alice can decrypt it
ÁîöËá≥Êñá‰ª∂ÁöÑÂèëÈÄÅËÄÖAliceÈÉΩ‰∏çËÉΩËß£ÂºÄBobÊî∂Âà∞ÁöÑÊñá‰ª∂

because she doesn‚Äôt have Bob‚Äôs private key
Âõ†‰∏∫Â•πÊ≤°ÊúâBobÁöÑÁßÅÈí•

The strength and security of the asymmetric encryption now relies on Alice and Bob to keep their private keys well protected
Â¶ÇÊûúÁßÅÈí•Ê≥ÑÈú≤ÔºåÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜÁöÑÂÆâÂÖ®ÊÄßÂ∞±‰ºöÈôç‰Ωé

If an attacker steals Alice‚Äôs private key
Â¶ÇÊûúÂÖ•‰æµËÄÖÂÅ∑Âà∞‰∫ÜAliceÁöÑÁßÅÈí•

it can be used to decrypt all messages that are intended for Alice
Â•πÁöÑÊî∂‰ª∂ÁÆ±Â∞±ÂÆåÂÖ®Êö¥Èú≤‰∫Ü

However, the attacker cannot decrypt messages that were sent by Alice
ÁÑ∂ËÄåÂÖ•‰æµËÄÖÊó†Ê≥ïÂÅ∑ÁúãAliceÁöÑÂèë‰ª∂ÁÆ±

because that requires Bob‚Äôs private key
Âõ†‰∏∫ÂÖ•‰æµËÄÖÊ≤°ÊúâBobÔºàÊî∂‰ª∂‰∫∫ÔºâÁöÑÁßÅÈí•

Asymmetric encryption is used in a lot places where security really matters
Âú®Ê≥®Èáç‰ø°ÊÅØÂÆâÂÖ®ÁöÑÂú∞ÊñπÔºåÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜÈùûÂ∏∏Â∏∏ËßÅ

You might not be aware of it
‰Ω†ÂèØËÉΩ‰∏çÁü•ÈÅì

but every time you visit a secure website via HTTPS, 
ÊØèÊ¨°Áî®HTTPSËÆøÈóÆÂÆâÂÖ®ÁΩëÁ´ôÊó∂

you are actually using asymmetric encryption
‰Ω†Âç≥Âú®‰ΩøÁî®ÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜ

It‚Äôs also being used to securely send emails with PGP protocol 
ÁîµÂ≠êÈÇÆ‰ª∂ÁöÑPGPÂä†ÂØÜ‰πüÊòØÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜ

and one last example: bitcoin also uses asymmetric encryption 
ËøòÊúâ‰∏Ä‰∏™‰æãÂ≠êÔºåÊØîÁâπÂ∏ÅÁî®ÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜ

to make sure that only the owner of the money wallet

can withdraw or transfer money from it
ËÉΩ‰ªé‰∏≠ÂèñÈí±ÂíåËΩ¨Ë¥¶

So now you know how asymmetric encryption works 
‰∏äËø∞Âç≥‰∏∫ÈùûÂØπÁß∞Âä†ÂØÜÁöÑÂéüÁêÜ

UgzPDJxSQIOkT4jPwbF4AaABAg.8bref0ZQq3N8buiHnsrbEa;2018-01-27T05:14:03Z;"For RSA, it's simple.  You have a trapdoor function, a function that is easy to do one way but hard to pull back.
To understand, we first need to know how RSA works.
If you don't want to see the underlying math in generating all the variables, I've sectioned it out for you.

----- BEGIN MATHS -----
We start off with two large prime numbers, p and q.  For the sake of demonstration, I'll just use 5 and 11.
p = 5
q = 11
We then calculate n and phi(n).  n is p*q and phi(n) is (p-1)*(q-1).
n = p*q = 5*11 = 55
phi(n) = (p-1)*(q-1) = (5-1)*(11-1) = 4*10 = 40
Knowing phi(n), we then pick another number e that is random (usually 65537; for demonstration purposes I'll use 3) and co-prime to phi(n) (in other words; it shouldn't be a factor of phi(n)).
e = 3
Then, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to calculate d.
e * d mod phi(n) = 1
3 * d mod 40 = 1
d = 27

Now, we've calculated all of our variables.
Unimportant variables:
p = 5
q = 11
phi(n) = 40
Important variables:
n = 55
e = 3
d = 27
Note that these numbers are way too small to use in any real life applications.
A little side note, modulus is simply the remainder to a division problem.
Also, phi(n) is euler's totient function, which is basically how many numbers aren't multiples of factors of n below n and above 0.  For a prime number (x in this case), phi(x) = x - 1.
----- END MATHS -----

n is called the 'modulus,' e is called the 'public exponent,' and d is called the 'private exponent.'

So now we have our modulus, public exponent, and private exponent.
We create our 'public key' using our public exponent and modulus.  We have a public key now, (3, 55).  We then make it available to anyone who wants it.  And we then have our private key which we keep a secret, which is (27, 55).  To encrypt text, we use:
C = (p^e)%n
or, in our case,
C = (p^3)%55
where C is the ciphertext, p is the plaintext (data to encrypt), e is the public exponent (3), and n is the modulus (55).  If we put the number 18 in for p, we get the number 2.
We can then send 2 over an insecure channel. Unless someone else encrypts the number 18 or factorizes the modulus, only we can decrypt it.  To do so, the equation is practically the same:
P = (c^d)%n
or, in our case,
P = (c^27)%55
where P is the plaintext (decrypted data), c is the ciphertext (encrypted data), d is the private exponent (27), and n is the modulus (55).  If we put 2 in for c, we get 18 back out.
We just successfully encrypted and decrypted data using a simple RSA example!


Anyways, back to our trapdoor function.  You publish the public exponent and the modulus, while safeguarding the private exponent (and sometimes the original primes).  The private exponent can only be calculated with phi(n), which is hard to calculate for large numbers without knowing the original primes.  *The only way to find out the original primes is to factorize it, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming for extremely large numbers.*  Knowing the original primes is the most efficient way to calculate phi(n) which is the most efficient (and nearly only) way to calculate the private exponent.

So, to answer your questions:
How can a public key be linked to a private key, yet you can't derive the private key from the public key?  (Note that the private key usually contains the original primes and the public/private exponents, so its easy to generate a public key from a private key)
As I said, it is hard to factorize the modulus provided that the numbers are large enough.  In terms of linking, however, if you read the math, you can see that the modulus and public exponent are used together with some secret data to form the private exponent.

How can you check if they're linked?
The easiest way is, well, to encrypt data with one and see if its decrypted with the other!

How can you be sure that a hacker can't derive the private key from public info?
Well, as I said, the modulus is hard to factorize provided it is done right.  The trapdoor function makes it easy for cheap phones to generate keypairs by multiplying in a few seconds (the biggest challenge being gathering enough random data), whereas supercomputers in universities can't factorize the same numbers in a reasonable amount of time.";Minecraft Coding & Music;2;

If that is right, I can't seem to follow until the end. How do you give someone your public key as it's an address that everyone may already know. If everyone knows it, everyone can access it. That's where I can't follow. How does the system know that it is only for a specific person's eyes? Also, if you set a password on a PDF file for example, the other person would need the password aka the private key. Just like you said, if you send that password over email, other people might be able to access it. How do you solve this problem?

I tried to think hard and summarize all my last month payments (in fiat)  and very few where I paid twice and could have used the lighting network. 90% of my payments are unique, but this is only me, so let`s assume the best case scenario where only 20% of people`s payments are unique, and 80% can use the lighting network. That could result in a 5 fold speed increase in bitcoin network theoretically. Still nowhere near to Visa.....  5 times the current 4 transaction/sec  is still only 20 transaction/sec.

The private key is what gives you ownership of the address. You can not make a fake transaction. You dont need blockchains to prevent that. What you do need blockchains for, is to make it impossible to re-order  or delete transactions, thereby letting you double spend.;P44man;3;

And while the money is hold up in the contract, nobody owns it and nobody can take it!;Simply Explained;1;

UgwaGSPEgWSl6tLTjxN4AaABAg;2018-02-12T23:21:56Z;Still doesn't make any sense.  What if a new node joins, is given a fresh copy of the ledger (by whom? we still don't know that yet), then the new node's power goes off for a week, and when it comes back on, the new ledger doesn't correspond with the old one, and all of the new blocks would be rejected.  The way it is explained here, the problem of unupdatable nodes would result in all transactions being rejected.   Obviously that's not the way it works, but if it isn't I'm still trying to find an explanation.  Something tells me I'm not going to find one because all of these cryptos are giant ponzi scheme scams!!!;annihilationHaven;0;

UgyZnqrKdOaWQ3NOCex4AaABAg;2018-02-15T17:01:32Z;"In a""real blockchain"", does it really keep adding the mining reward to the pending transactions list; and then another miner has to mine that transaction? Wouldn't this create an endless cycle of rewards, which of cause keeps introducing new bitcoins to the system. 
What I thought happens when someone mines a block is that the mining reward is added to the same block that just got mined.
Is that right?";Ruch;2;

if you had 1,2,3 then you can see 2 commas while there are 3 numbers. Remove the numbers and replace the commas with 0 and you Get 00

Try this: *console.log(new Array("""","""","""").join(""0""));*
it is The same as this:  *console.log(new Array(3).join(""0""));*

However you could make your observers asynchronous and distributed. Being async will allow you to quickly go through the foreach loop (since you don't have to wait for the return values). After that you spread the load among a number of computers who all work on handling a part of the observers.;Simply Explained;1;

UgzESSK427RGrAf8qtd4AaABAg;2018-02-28T01:58:27Z;"This was a very interesting video!

Their usage of multiple CPUs for redundancy is very clever, but I wonder how they manage to keep performance at optimum levels. Given that split second decisions can have a huge impact on the results. Your comment about game developers might contribute to this - they similarly have to write code that has consistent performance characteristics, you don‚Äôt want something that normally takes 5ms taking 100ms because it encountered a worst-case scenario.
The choice of OS and language also contributes to this - a garbage collector or JIT compiler wouldn‚Äôt provide nearly the consistency they would need.
I find it amazing that they can even spare the time to compare the results between CPUs, especially given that they likely have the CPUs spread out to provide extra redundancy, further increasing latency. That said, maybe the latency is so large that it outweighs any gains that could be made from increased performance.

In summary - they face very interesting challenges, and it‚Äôs cool to hear about it.";Noah McCann;172;

UgzVu30_CxmrMV9eKOd4AaABAg;2018-02-28T04:04:09Z;This video is mostly correct.

UgyM71Gh8HGgK0aRn6h4AaABAg.8aIZ9hngLOm8dCRHx9-Kd-;2018-02-28T08:13:45Z;Yes to both. If someone obtains your private keys, you are screwed. Which is why its so important to learn how to secure them, and why in practice for non trivial sums, you want to use a hardware wallet, like a trezor or ledger. These are USB devices which store the keys on a physical device that can not be tampered with via software. The private keys never leave the device. You can ask these devices to sign a transaction (after you enter the pin code, verify the address and amount on the screen) and you can broadcast that signed transaction to do a payment. But the private keys never leave the device and cant be read or hacked. You can restore the keys from a deterministic seed phrase should you lose the devices or if it gets damaged or destroyed. Of course, that seed needs to be kept secure as well.;P44man;3;

BTW u dont need multiple  paralell CPU for the CPU problem you just need one that does the same calculation 3 times. But still the CPU and the software can not know if a bit flip had happened.
I see it as an impossible problem. RAM bit flips are worse cause radiation has much greater chance to affect the RAM since the content of the RAM is not accessed that frequently. IMHO as I said you dont need multiple CPU you just need to do the calc a couple of times instead. 
And in this long time a strike on RAM is more likely.

Starman is not going to Mars after all.

I dont think they should keep being this optimistic and go for radiation hardened instead.";MajSolo;0;

Same applies to Ethereum as they can roll back disliked outcomes with forks. Almost all cryptocurrencies have ways of controlling funds and most of them aren't in BETA as IOTA. Those cryptocurrencies are what they will always be. IOTA's reclaim is no different than that time millions of BTC were produced out of thin air--it's amazing what growing pains are forgotten and how IOTA, as BETA, is being compared to Bitcoin in its final stage--it's a double standard that has no basis in reality. Now, if IOTA still uses a coordinator, or has a reclaim process,  in another 8 years, that will be a fair comparison.;Genxthis;0;

UgwnZLJagNpJ0X5ZdlR4AaABAg;2018-03-02T15:52:50Z;You can actually make computer hardware very resistant to radiation by using a 3 layer protection, the outer layer being beryllium which is a metal with the ability to reflect all forms of radiation, the middle layer being graphyte which acts as a filter against powerful gamma rays, and finally the innermost layer being a thin sheet of lead which catches and absorbs runaway radiation that manages to penetrate the first 2 layers, beryllium and graphyte is normally very lightweight and wouldnt affect the total weight of the satellite or space station very much (and beryllium can also be manufactured as a sealing tape incase a micrometeor penetrates the hull), lead is normally very heavy since normally upto 4cm is required to shield objects from solar radiation, but since the previous 2 layers already do that the lead will only need to be thick enough to catch the remaining radiation and would only need to be as thick as aluminum foil;chloe kaftan;0;

Thx for sharing, very good video.

Is it very complex to take the block data from a cloud and put it to the chain?

My project:

- read nfc tag with arduino
- put this data in the cloud
-------------------------------------------
- take this data from the cloud and put it to the chain
-------------------------------------------

I'm not a dev. I try to combine the topics IoT and Blockchain for a student project. I only want to demonstrate how it could work. Without thinking about security and real implementation.

If it's to complex to take the data from the cloud, maybe it's better to take the data from a file?

Like I said, it's only for demonstrating purpose.

Seriously though, I hope they have look at the Rust programming language. It's just as fast as C++ but much more reliable. Unlike C++, Rust actually takes advantage of the past 50 years of advancements made in computer science research and practice. C++ may be popular but it's a terrible language for safety critical systems. To use it for the flight control system I can only presume that they must have spent a great deal of money on static analysis software and have huge team of testers.;Robert McAlery;1;

UgxSDThh3xZQdBMciTh4AaABAg;2018-03-08T19:17:21Z;"Blockchain - Another  HUGE  HOAX!

Complete utter hogwash! But proves that BS , still baffles brains. 

The key to this massive hoax is, firstly, revealed at the point of data capture; in terms of the nature of information or transactions being collected in each block. Irrespective of any value-audit at the point of data capture, everyone knows, that the value of any information or transaction; anywhere on this planet is constantly changing ,-  in fact, the laws of thermodynamics  support the reality of physical and abstract value fluidity in the universe and on this planet, largely because;  on  a whole, it is moving towards chaos, or for that matter, a ZERO VALUE condition under the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, the value audit is only meaningful at the point of initial data capture.

""If it is too good to be true; it probably is... '  

Leading to another massive hole in this  concept, in that there is also  nothing in this technology that provides an on-going optic or measurement of the transaction or information values collected, in any of the chained blocks within the chain (i.e. there is no innate or inside the block  value thermometer) beyond the point of data capture - so by the time you go to open the block, some decades from now, you will most likely find that there is actually little or nothing of value there - which should come as no surprise to anyone, because we live on a finite planet that is of less aggregate value with each passing moment, as its non-renewable resources are being concurrently depleted with growing populations. The opened empty block  would hence, conform as expected, with both the laws of the universe and noted planetary constraints.

In other words, you would have to insanely stupid to think that you can defeat the physical laws and constraints of the universe with the high technology of mere snake-oil semantics and mathematics, combined with zealous  criminal propaganda, seeking bigger fools happy  to buy the next voodoo tulip bulb you create for sale to a naive public. 

So as Shakespeare once prolifically remarked, ""A fraud by any other name; would still be a blockchain"" Hmm...

And it is to discourage spammers wanting to clog / tamper our Blockchain?
But wasn't Blockchain distributed , and with mechanism to identify tampered block using consenses ?

Making code slow, isn't the smartest thing, I would imagine.

I think it's just to make miners feel that they have 'earned' it & deserve it.";Dhaval Shah;0;

UgxFFJK7h-6xgFPyOjV4AaABAg;2018-03-09T14:24:41Z;"Basically, Bitcoin Cash provides an alternative to the changes made on the Bitcoin project. You can't deny Roger (and many others) has a point on not being happy with the direction, BTC is now facing. 
He didn't even invent BCH, (what most of you do not seem to know), he just hopped on the chain he thought to be better. And all he is doing is emphasising on why BCH, as the original p2p cash system has more utility and therefore ultimately is the better (or only) store of value. 

You can bitch all you want about Rogers personality, but remember: None of you and all the other BCH haters come off any way less unlikeable, than a triggered Ver. BCH remains nothing but an alternative Bitcoin Chain, that delivers to the needs of the people wanting it to be used as p2p cash without complex to implement solutions like LN. Since BTC didn't deliver still up to this day and you guys could care less, why would anyone even care?  Because ""Bitcoin Cash stole the Brandname?"". Is this now the only argument, next to ""BCASH-BCASH-BCASH"" you guys can come up with? You guys want to tell me you care for the people, that want to buy BTC but buy BCH instead? crocodile tears, i tell you.

and if bitcoin cash would be called B-token anyone would be happy with that altcoin and support roger in his cause to bank the unbanked? highly doubt it.";K√§ptn Kook;0;

E.g. did you use C/C++, continuous integration, store logs with source code, test on actual hardware etc as mentioned here? I believe I read somewhere that SpaceX built a board with all the various hardware components, actuators etc controlled by the computers, so that they could test the software against actual hardware.

However that sounded like a no brainer to me. Would not all space companies do this? Or was your software only really tested upon launch of a rocket?";Erik Engheim;1;

1. What are the most common programming languages in the space industry and does language choice vary a lot with system it is used for?
2. Do other space companies NOT test code continuously against actual hardware? What procedure do they use then to test against real hardware? On launch site, once a blue moon?";Erik Engheim;0;

In many of the examples there is more complex matters and shades of gray. I agree with you that these case still require 3rd party / human judgement. I am also of the oppinion that a blockchain of people sitting behind a computer will in no way be able to judge what actually happened in more complex examples. I.e I had a leak in my house, I claim to my insurance etc. Insurance company says I have not done my roof right or maintained it well enough to qualify. We have a disagreement. How will a blockchain judge who is right?? This is where qualified 3rd party surveyors come in, but it still becommes a matter of a human being, and his bias what decision is reached.;Michael M√∏rland;1;

(eg checkout visualdsp++). you think they come out of thin air? 

it's not necessary that spacex would write their own compiler, but say they use a special ""space processor"", it is likely that it'll come with an exotic compiler/linker/optimizier. again, this means fewer developers have deep knowledge of the toolchain, which can cost time. by using x86 and a standard gcc toolchain, every c++ developer can immediately go to work. (you know, like the video explains it, if you had listened)

there is also one thing which i believe wasn't mentioned: every compiler has bugs. the more users a compiler has, the less bugs it will have. again, this makes gcc+x86 a strong choice.";hansiraber;0;

This means that block tampering attack can still be easily mounted by re-computing hashes of the victim block and all blocks afterwards. 
In such an attack, the difficulty can be ignored and the chain will still be valid since you don't check whether each hash actually has the right number of preceding zeroes.

On the other hand, bitcoin is controlled by no one. That is bad thing because its value is not protected. Because of this, bitcoin fails to meet definition of currency: it must be a store of value.

Do you think they are going to expend energy to mine something that would immediately become worthless upon a 51% attack? The only way a pool could pull this off is if they owned every miner that was connected and even then they would only be able to maybe falsify one block. The amount of work to falsify 2 or 3 especially in a network like bitcoin is impossible even if pools coordinated an attack.;Adam Shepherd;9;

For me Proof of Work is a subsidiary of Proof of Stake.

Both require you to stake something; in the POW it is electricity and subsequently FIAT money.
In POS, it is the cryptocurrency.

Regarding the 51% attack, miner would in reality need somewhere around 65%, 51% would make the attack ""possible"" but still highly unlikely. Plus, once the network sees what you are doing, they will kick you out and reduce the damages that you have made. In reality, if you invest enough money to initiate a 51% attack, you soon realise that you could use this to make more money, if you use it to secure the network";Ken Shamir;0;

UgyJg47oM6BWFHHi8q14AaABAg;2018-03-25T18:44:47Z;"I am curious about the following use case:

Let's say I am visiting a city for the day and decide to buy a coffee from Coffeeshop. I know that I will only order one coffee since I do not live there, so I pay using the lightning network, opening up a payment channel with Coffeeshop. Since I am only visiting, I decide to close the payment channel directly after the transaction takes place.

I understand that the transaction would be instant using the lightning network (correct me if I am wrong), but would I not have to pay the same transaction fee for the one coffee using the lightning network as I would using the Bitcoin network directly?

I can see where the lightning network would benefit multiple purchases through one vendor, but I am having a difficult time understanding the value for the one-time transaction use case mentioned above. Thanks in advance.";Michael Reha;0;

Ugzubturt1OfopZseuB4AaABAg;2018-04-03T20:22:38Z;"There are several inaccuracies in this video. First of all, the Ariane V did not crash because of an invalid cast from 64 to 16 bit, the overflow was in an unused software component that had been carried over from the Ariane 4 and would normally have done nothing. The reason why the rocket failed was because the overflow caused an uncaught exception to be thrown. TLDR exceptions were a terrible idea.

Another error is the use of linux at spacex. Linux is completely unsuitable for hard real-time applications because among other things it does not have an execution time upper bound on its scheduler. Linux is used on desktop computers but not on the actual rocket.

I have a question though, in the example, I tried to tamper data and did recalculation of current hash and assigned to existing hash. I got output as true. We are not tampering anything with previous block hash. Basically I have not understand the check on current block hash with the previous block hash as for me it always return true.

Also if I carefully watch video , when you do a tampering and set current hash. It gives output as false. However if I examine your console which is on this video, both previous hash and current hash seems to be identical. Then how does it return false?

UgyOm4vtq_5leo86uN94AaABAg.8ZBlxOs3pqL8f2ypTlMQD6;2018-04-15T09:05:57Z;"a type is more of an alias. So you can have a type *TransportationMethod = Train | Car | Bike;* , this makes it easier to declare a type on a variable. Instead of typing *let transportMethod: Train | Car | Bike = new TrainTransport();* you can type *let transportMethod: TransportationMethod = new CarTransport();* .

an interface gives you more flexibility with *extending* and *augmenting* . In the above example you could have the Train/Car/BikeTransport methods implement the TransportationMethod interface. You can then again say *let transportMethod: TransportationMethod = new BikeTransport();* . 
Let's say you got a request from somebody to implement a Boat transport method. Once again you implement the BoatTransport using the TransportationMethod interface. Now everywhere where you assigned something of interface TransportationMethod you can also use the new BoatTransport. This would be akin to changing the type to TransportationMethod = Train | Car | Bike | Boat;. So in this case not really a big difference vs. types.

The big difference comes when later in your app development you decide to add a new feature; a routeplanner. You can now *augment* the TransportationMethod interface with a routePlanner() method. 
You can also create a new interface called RoutePlanner and use that to *extend* the existing TransportationMethod interface using the *implements* feature.

So while types & interfaces share some aspects, interfaces give you a lot more flexibility and thus are generally preferred to types.";Paretozen;2;

If I understand correctly, the miner is simply changing the nonce until the block difficulty is met (please confirm if I'm incorrect here).  If so, wouldn't every miner start at nonce 0 and work up by 1 sequentially, therefore whoever has the most computing power would solve every block?  Or, is it more efficient to randomize the nonce?

Ugy_XLaYPFV2RGhPkHp4AaABAg.8XMSLUdGK078fHkpGvZQAh;2018-04-21T02:52:12Z;With Bitcoin, this would be similar to two new blocks being mined at approximately the same time. There will be two valid chains until one of the chains is longer and is accepted by nodes as the authoritative chain representing the most work. With each block added onto the chain, the odds of the chains remaining the same in length exponentially decreases.;AB CD;0;
Ugwqx5_RNNZ3OvpJZf14AaABAg.8d0b66bmGEh8fHl9Pa4B37;2018-04-21T02:55:05Z;That's the idea. If you want to cheat the system, you need to recalculate the entire blockchain beginning with the first block you tamper with.

Then, can't he send some malware to the distributed blockchain network and corrupt the entire network?

Ugyjo3VK9j6hjLU_KEN4AaABAg.8fmFO0FPEC18fmp9JYpRVw;2018-05-03T13:45:43Z;The salt is there to prevent you from cracking multiple passwords at once. Imagine 5 users have the same password. If you don't use a salt, the hashes of these passwords will be the same. So if you crack 1, you instantly know the others as well. With a salt however you have to crack each one individually. They also protect against rainbow tables and dictionary attacks. It's not perfect, but helps! (Also look at bcrypt: they generate 1 hash that contains the salt in plain text) You really can store them together.;Simply Explained;1;

Also in your example of using the file hash to ensure no tampering was done to the file you‚Äôd still be downloading the content before being able to hash it so the nefarious user has still managed to get the content onto your system. Do they plan on providing some incentive against this? Maybe an intelligent blacklist on the client‚Äôs that would start to ignore content served from and ignore requests to serve other nodes that don‚Äôt play nicely? Eventually those nodes would be cut off from the network.

In any case, very interesting topic and well described (and animated)!";Noah McCann;8;

UgiC2YJbbOkcFngCoAEC.8TKSJ71M5-I8gh4rkEql1O;2018-05-26T04:47:41Z;I disagree with that. Annotations are an implementation of the decorator pattern that comes with the language. In Vanilla JS and Python a Decorator is simply a function that takes as a parameter another function and uses the result of the latter before or after some other computation. In React JS for example, a very popular JS library, HOC are essentially decorators. Annotations are a feature of the language that allows you to write @whatever instead of whatever(f). But, in Typescript there's also more. You have actually object descriptors and reflection that you can use.;Davide Pugliese;2;

With IBM, they are storing the blockchain in IBM Cloud, meaning that IBM has full control over the blockchain's data. So how can we call it immutable? IBM has full control over all the nodes running in their cloud which store a copy of the blockchain. They can easily just change all the data in all of the nodes. So IBM Blockchain is really not much different from IBM's normal database services. I don't understand how IBM is selling this idea to customers like Walmart... They're basically saying with blockchains, you can trust the food data. But then are they saying that you can't trust the food data if it was stored in a regular IBM database? 

It just leads me to believe that companies like IBM are just trying to capitalize on this blockchain hype, and selling their so called ""transparent and secure"" services to customers who are unaware of how blockchains are meant to work.

UgyAoX9ii1l4Gq-T_qR4AaABAg.8gt-bn7GEsf8gx2EZHdMVC;2018-06-01T09:32:34Z;"Food tracking is perfectly doable. Put a tag on each piece of food and have companies scan it when it enters/leaves their facilities. It gets harvested? Farmer adds that event to the blockchain. Arrives at a shipping company, they add it as well. Arrives at the store, they add another event. Customer buys it, another event.


The used consensus algorithm is of no importance. You can use PoW or PoS, doesn't really matter as long as the chosen algorithm does in fact generate consensus amongst everyone on the network. The ""validators"" or ""miners"" in this example are every company who is involved in the process. They want to make sure that the data is not tampered with (so that the store cannot accuse the shipping company of bad practices for instance).

Let's say you write a smart contract that automatically compensates people who have been affected by a hurricane. To do that you use the API of a weather service. Problem is: how can you trust the output of that API? It can change its response with every request you make and you have no way of seeing all the responses it gave over time. To solve it, the weather service should publish its measurements on the blockchain. That way you have a verifiable and immutable trail of data.

UgxOdGQPRn0PKEGe0s94AaABAg.8hBI22-Qg1b8hBPvTdtudJ;2018-06-07T08:48:09Z;"This is an awesome question! The storage requirements is definitely a possible pitfall for blockchains, however time is on their side. On may 1st, the Bitcoin blockchain was 156,3GB in size and 1 month later was 159,6GB. That's an increase of little over 3GB every month or 36GB per year. That's not fast enough to outgrow the capacity of nodes on the network. Also consider that storage nowadays is pretty cheap and the capacity of hard drives increases regularly. So the storage problem doesn't have to be solved immediately, there is still time left! However it will be very important as blockchains become more performant and handle more and more transactions per second.

Also note that certain developers are already working on this problem. Cardano for instance is thinking about pruning the blockchain and sharding/partitioning.";Simply Explained;0;

If companies adopt already existing cryptocurrencies, the problem of paying to validators is solved.
Scanning a barcode is just an example. All the other things that you have mentioned depend on the sensors available and the willingness to track something. Maybe the company just wants to know where the package is. Why would it then care about hygienic conditions? Any data can be put on the blockchain including temperature, humidity, hygienic conditions.
What do you mean by counterfeit barcodes? How many problems with barcodes have you seen in supermarkets now? Why would it be different? Don't get this question...

UgxLZKY9U-JNcc3pCet4AaABAg;2018-06-15T21:29:19Z;Vertical scalability, increases capacity by adding more resources, such as more memory or an additional CPU, to a machine. Scaling vertically, which is also called scaling up, usually requires downtime while new resources are being added and has limits that are defined by hardware. Horizontal scaling affords the ability to scale wider to deal with traffic. It is the ability to connect multiple hardware or software entities, such as servers, so that they work as a single logical unit. Lambda is horizontally scaling. I think this point is important but was not explained well in this video. However, the video is of high quality.;Theta Gang Hustle;3;

It seems were not ready for a truely free crypto until the power and validation is also decentralized.. Not sort of decentralized.. Every person needs to be their own central bank essentially. Right now it feels like we're under a 51% attack. Many of the early investors may have had ties London finance and they may hold beliefs that crypto needs regulation. I we aren't the regulators and creditors and customers and providers then essentially we have just helped fund our own slavery... A  fedcoin.. Lest we not let this happen please. Crypto instead is bought and sold and traded and shorted and pumped and dumped and manipulated at what end? And private keys.. Who thought that was a good idea? It's the furthest from being user friendly. Could be a long crypto winter folks. I'm still bullish because the way the news anchors talk trash about crypto and the crypto communties in general.

Webmasters have visitor attention, behavior information and pseudo-anonymous identity information about visitor. And they have power to do stuff with it - store, process, sell and so on.

They can sell user attention for money as ads, for example, or, in this case, webmasters chose to trade bit of information about user for a social network widget.;bergonius;0;

Crypto currency is only getting popular because of
1.curiosity 
2.the first wave of buyers actually made money because of higher demand (rising prices).
3. anonymity 

I predict that it wont replace official currencies anytime soon because those 2 first reasons wont be valid anymore, buyers will actually start losing money and fear will spread among other owners.

such gateways see the signature of the file you want to have and direct you to the right nodes. that means that you know the content in advance without downloading.

as far as malware, you only share the things you get a copy of, just like the regular internet, if you don't want to host malware... don't go to shady places , its the same deal.

as far as filecoin and hosting things you don't , they are fragmented and can't be accessed by accident , so even if you are hosting a part of something dangerous, you are not accessing it so no harm can be done, its like an unloaded gun, it won't shoot on its own without you touching it

However editing articles is something that IPFS doesn't support. That has to be handled by another layer.

In a business perspective and other use cases, public Blockchain or Permissionless Blockchain will not be suitable. Confidentiality in Data comes in picture. In permissioned Blockchain , we can create a separate channel between the two parties involved  . And it is Decentralized , however the nodes will be chosen beforehand. People (nodes) should be  a valid participant in the network .

Ugw1AEU7iLs94oqJ9NV4AaABAg;2018-07-01T01:08:25Z;"DigiByte anticipated the scalability issues that would plague Bitcoin adoption. Thus, DGB designed it's blockchain so that it could handle Visa/Mastercard levels of volume, all while keeping all transactions on the blockchain. The problem with the Lightning Network is that it is an off-chain (meaning outside the blockchain) ""solution"".  This is no solution at all, for if we're okay with off-chain solutions, we might as well stick with Visa/Mastercard because they're already digital and already super fast.  Also, LN risks centralization because it'll have centralized hubs.  If you believe in the true spirit of crypto, you should be very leery of Lightning Network.";Craig Candor;2;

UgxgxZ6P3tJ-Bn4vuXJ4AaABAg.8eV2WGgDHaB8iSLMxchBVy;2018-07-08T19:06:50Z;Simply Explained - Savjee every piece of circuitry is thermally bonded to the chassis.  When in direct sunlight, the chassis will heat up, otherwise it cools down.  You size the thermal mass and the surface area of your dissipator to set how wide the temperature swing will be.  When I worked on cube sats in college, the range could be -50 to +80 C.  You have to design your stuff to handle that.  The temperatures you list are asymptotic limits.  If the spacecraft were fixed on either the dark on light side of the earth, the chassis will reach that temperature, and so will the electronics.;EGL24Xx;0;

UgysZBiMhmBEdj07Z1h4AaABAg;2018-07-10T07:08:20Z;"So, this being said, why would you replace a third party with a smart contract? My answer is that having a smart contract in place, you will be charged a small fee when a transaction is made(when the smart contract gets executed). 
As far as i know, this is the smart contract business model the companies are using right now. So, replacing a third party with a smart contract is a very effective way to lower your business costs. (First big advantage)
But, from my point of view, there is another advantage of having a smart contract in place. As this video explains, the smart contracts are blockchain based, and there is very slightly chance for this to be corrupted/hacked. 
What is really important here is that behind a smart contract there is CODE written. This means that when you replace a paper contract with a smart contract, you become digital. You actually replace words...with code. 
And the real advantage here is that the code is not doubtful...it will always execute the same way. (Second big advantage)

Ugzedi7YK-juHQDuPm54AaABAg;2018-07-18T16:00:40Z;"Hi @Savjee, Really excellect video once again.. I have two queries :

1. As I understand, RTC is a counter which keeps track of the no of oscillations of the quartz crystal you've mentioned that when the computer boots up the OS will read time from RTC. How can the OS determine the exact time without the offset. 

Let's say I shutdown my system at 5 PM and switched it back on at 6 PM, meanwhile let's say RTC's counter has incremented 555 times. In this example, 555 is the duration. OS can only know its 6 PM if it had stored the offset 5 PM. [Let me know if I'm not clear]

2. How does OS account for network delays when syncing with atomic clocks using NTP ?";Goutham Kolluru;0;

In a KeyConditionExpression the condition for the sort key has to be combined with the condition on the partition key. In this example date is the partition key, which means you have to query for an exact match. In order for you to use the between operator the sort key would have to be the date and the partition key a message_id (or something like that). I think it would require a redesign of the table.

Incorrect. 51% doesn't allow you to create fraudulent transactions. Other nodes will mark the block as invalid, reject the block, and ban the nodes announcing these. This means that all the miners' hard work is wasted.

Ugzi_0zaxvjksD8mwBB4AaABAg;2018-08-26T09:55:18Z;"This is an amazing tutorial but would like to point out a small mistake. Isn't the isChainValid() method incorrect? Like it works if you modify the contents of the first block because it enters the for loop when i=1, but it finishes returning by then. So if you change the contents of the second block, the check will only be done for the first block and it will return true. I think something like this would work :
isChainValid() {
        let flag = true;
        for (let i = 1; i < this.chain.length; i++) {
            const currentBlock = this.chain[i];
            const previousBlock = this.chain[i - 1];

            if (currentBlock.hash !== currentBlock.calculateHash()) {
                flag = false;
            }
            
            if (currentBlock.previousHash !== previousBlock.hash) {

UgyhAnuZT-CBxE0Ofmh4AaABAg;2018-09-01T05:27:21Z;"Very important correction: 1GHz processor doesn't necessarily mean it's 1billion instructions per second, but rather 1billion cycles per second. The cycle is literally an electrical wave (imagine it as ""sin"" graph). One instruction, however, can be measured in number of cycles and that's dependent of the machine architecture. So for example if a machine architecture decided that ""addition"" instruction needs 2 cycles, and that machine has a a processor of 1GHz:
1GHz ---> 1billion cycles per second ---> 500million addition instructions per second. A processor usually has many more instructions each of which requires different number of cycles. So measuring a processor's frequency in number of instructions per second is hard unless every instruction cost exactly 1 cycle, which is not realistic.

LN routing requires knowledge of available paths, which means they have to solve the routing problem. They keep saying things like ""the internet works, we'll do it like that"", but the internet is built on trust and that trust is violated on a weekly basis.

The theoretical maximum transactions is infinite, but the maintainance costs for the network are not there exist estimates out there that suggests that you will be able to have somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 routing nodes before the system becomes unusable for all but the strongest and most well-connected nodes.

The solution acccording to market demand is likely to be few hubs with many connections, which would also help by acting as liquidity providers; giving those with money the ability to control / deny access.

In particular, when the underlying base layer fee subsidies (block rewards) approach zero, the costs of those 7 TPS on the main chain will be extreme and only the powerful high-speed centralized hubs will be able to afford it.

They also have all benefits from being gatekeepers so they will out-compete all regular usage on the main chain for pure profit, re-instating similar institutions and gatekeepers we initially adopted cryptocurrencies to remove.";Jonathan Silverblood;0;
Ugw0tqrTG9WS95RAsn54AaABAg.8a8cIV4qfQr8kwExHqbBgy;2018-09-08T12:10:00Z;"In theory you are supposed to keep a handful of channels open, and route through others when you encounter new merchants.

There is so many holes in this theory though, that it isn't funny. For example, do you think it would be reasonable for your local pizza shop to route other peopels money? Do you think parties that has the power to deny access (hubs/the other side of your channels) will be free from regulation?

I can't imagine a world where banks have to do KYC and AML, but a toy store can make money helping others transact without the state intervening and demanding that the toy store either sign up for money transmission licenses and do KYC and AML, or be forced to shut down operation altogether - likely with hefty fines.";Jonathan Silverblood;0;

I keep my coins in a Nano S, so I don't worry about them, I'm just not sure how it handles forks.  I'd think that, if the main chain is completely copied, all the addresses up to that point would be the same for both new and old coins.

They're trying to - unofficially - put the Dollar on an Oil Standard. You can only fiat it in the short term. As soon as you have you have a single year in which the market doesn't grow, you get a nationwide apocalypse. It's why today's recession's are so catastrophic. It's why the government HAS to bail out failing industry. Because if we get economic shrinkage, even for a small amount of time, the whole monetary system collapses.

The austrians - the von Mises guys - have been warning of this for years. They were among the first to predict the 2008 crash. They also predicted - not taking into account government intervention - the collapse of the Dollar. And the government bailing out the banks only serves to kick the can down the road. The next recession will be worse. The one after that, even more so. Until the government WON'T be able to bail the business out.

Now, as for crypto, aside from it being a very stupid idea, you encounter even more problems. For one, a Bitcoin-like system incentivizes saving (HODL-ing, as it were). Fiat was built to incentivize spending. If you want adoption, you first have to get a lot of people holding a lot of assets in your crypto, so that business will take the risk in order to tap a large amount of the potential market (current fiat money avoid this problem by having the government enforce use of the money by force). Secondly, you need miners. THEY are the early adopters (maybe you can avoid this with Ethereum, or other established coins, but you want competition amongst coins, and new ones to arise all the time). Third, all money would ultimately gravitate towards a few nodes (especially if they wouldn't spend it).";Tiberius Gracchus;0;

If that were the case, words in our language that have been mutated to mean different things from their original purpose would not carry the negative or positive connotation they do.

In regard to Guy Fawkes, the majority of society associates it with ""Hacker"", good or bad (many people don't know ethical hackers exist). The devil is perceived as ""Evil"", so in this video, a devil would not be appropriate to the message being given. Tampering with blockchain blocks is not an evil process but rather a hacker process.

This way you can configure your API as proxy and let the lambda function handle response format.

On the other hand, you can leave ""proxy"" parameter unchecked and let the gateway handle response format. This way, you only return generatedNumber at your lambda function, and configure gateway to wrap it under a JSON format.";Ali Yƒ±lmaz;2;

Kick starter delivers the money to the product team, because they need money to pay their suppliers to make their project become alive. That is the point of funding. And if they fail to deliver the promised products to the backers, then kickstarter will ask the product team to return money. If they can not return, nothing to do(there are few examples happened before) and sometimes they manage to refund. But you're accepting the risk when you fund. 

So in this case, you say smart contract will not release the funded amount to product team until they deliver the promised products to the backers, but product team is not able to manufacture the product without this money, so this example is not a good example for smart contracts.

Ugx2tfPesaephUbOUm14AaABAg;2018-10-10T02:47:27Z;"How complex are smart contracts expected to be, and how do we know they'll work?  For example, I suppose a contract can stipulate the following simple transaction:

1) Purchaser selects article
2) Selected article is drawn from inventory by seller
3) Article is shipped by an approved carrier
4) Carrier obtains signature from purchaser or their agent (perhaps permissible agents must be specified)
5) Certain period of time elapses after signature to provide for return of defective or non-conforming article
6) Funds are irrevocably transferred

For your average John Doe, that will take a lot of computer code that isn't familiar to everyone (and Solidity isn't going to be here for much longer!), but let's continue.  John Doe doesn't want to hire a programmer, so he selects a proper-looking ready-made contract that has earned high approval from a certified board (certified by whom?, pray tell) designated to read the open-source code and certify that it does what it seems to be intended to do.  Of course, only certain board-certified open-source contracts will be offered by the seller.  We must hope that no unseen vulnerability has escaped the certified board (SQL insertion, overflow, the usual suspects).  If that happens, who's responsible?

It looks like we just added a whole layer of professional people to what used to be a simple dispute call to AmEx or Visa, but let's continue. 

Now, what if there's a complex contract that's unique to parties who are doing a large and costly project (Multiple sources, QC inspection, time restrictions, all-or-nothing execution, etc)?  First, as always, a legal team has to be engaged to write the contract in a way that suits the principal players.  In the absence of a perfunctory, one-size-fits-all contract like the sample above, a programming team has to be engaged to turn the legalese into computerese.  (Few lawyers speak English with boolen clarity, let alone Javascript, or C#, -- or Haskell!) Since there won't be a whole lot of repetition and board-certified reading of open-source contracts, an insurance company with its own code readers will have to be engaged to provide a bond that guarantees the correct behavior of the smart contract.  

Now we've added an insurance company to the smart contract writing company.  More overhead.

I suppose that, after 40 or 50 years, certain contract templates will be recognized by the business community, but before then, there will be lots of  unforseen circumstances and ensuing hostilities.  

Of course, even today, a contract is only a basic directive for parties who trust one another.  If someone's out to screw you, they'll put in some clause that your team doesn't catch and you'll be exposed to taking a loss.  The MAIN reason for a contract is to define rights and obligations, not to prevent dirty dealings.  If you the person you're dealing with isn't worthy of trust, no contract will help.  That's a rule.  

So, with all of that said, I feel that we're running headlong into a situation where people might be lulled into thinking things are ""trustless"".  I'm all for the level of trustlessness needed simply to transfer funds safely (like, to your brother.)  But there CAN'T be a trustless environment in ACTUAL BUSINESS.  

Any comments on these observations?  Maybe the only contract necessary (beyond the basic one I submitted) is the one for escrow -- and leave everything else just the way it has always been. The lawyers are headache enough!  In that case, the world will only need 1/2 dozen small, generally recognized smart contracts, right?  

So, my question restated is: Just what kinds of contracts are being proposed?  Everyday simple things, or matters of unique complexity?

(Sorry if I rambled a bit, but I think you get the gist of what I'm saying.)";dactylntrochee;0;
Ugyo6iylotbhHDUBIsp4AaABAg;2018-10-10T12:18:53Z;"""Even though the keys are linked together, they cannot be derived from each other"" 

Isn't that wrong? Sure, it might take so much computer power that you need a quantum computer to do it, but isn't it theoretically possible to derive a private key from the public key?

Isn't that why scientists are looking into better encryption methods in case quantum computing takes off?";The Harbo;6;
Ugx2tfPesaephUbOUm14AaABAg.8mCd-wTQ2718mDflMfLixF;2018-10-10T12:30:46Z;"Interesting question. First of all, as you said smart contracts should not be super complicated. The risks of having a bug in there is just too big. See the incident with the DAO that led to an Ethereum hard fork for instance.


If something happens with a smart contract, it's hard to point fingers. Just like with a real contract. If a certain clause is too vague, who's fault is that? The lawyer who wrote it? The people who reviewed it? At this point however the damage is already done so might as well try to recover instead of pointing fingers.

I follow your reasoning concerning the overhead. Creating a smart contract with the same amount of details as regular contracts will be very time consuming. But after that, the contract can operate autonomously and always give a binary output. There won't be any gray zones. If you look at insurances for instance, it would mean that they won't be able to come up with clever tactics to avoid a possible payout.


Hmm yes, you're also correct when you say that this system isn't entirely ""trustless"". You still have to trust the code of the contract as well as the network that runs it. Just as you have to trust the software that runs on your computer not to steal any personal data. So good point! Smart contracts make sure that we don't have a central authority but we still have to trust the system.


There are few smart contracts out there already, but nothing really complicated. There is the DAO which is a decentralized venture capital fund where people can vote for who should receive money. All tokens are powered by a smart contract. And so on...


But the summary is: most smart contracts today are relatively small and simple. There are also efforts to make ""standard"" contracts that are safe and can be re-used (such as the ERC20 standard that describes a smart contract to issue tokens on the Ethereum blockchain).";Simply Explained;0;
Ugx2tfPesaephUbOUm14AaABAg.8mCd-wTQ2718mDnDv2lEMT;2018-10-10T13:35:58Z;"Thanks for the quick reply.  I'll be interested to see how this goes.  So far, I have no personal interest in breedable cat pictures, magic game swords or ICOs, and I fear the insurance example isn't as cut-and-dried as we might hope.  

I can picture things like title transfer, but since house and car ownership require government registration, those things would probably still be done best on government servers.  

There's securities transfer (and I imagine that an all-or-nothing securities transfer can be done on a Turing-incomplete blockchain) and maybe visas for quota-controlled imports.   

I just don't automatically picture real-life use cases.  As I said, I'll be watching to see what becomes available -- the simple fact that I can't picture something doesn't mean it won't happen.  (My father was from Missouri, so I may ultimately have to be shown.)";dactylntrochee;0;

UgyfD3HD1WK3bDpVDdV4AaABAg;2018-10-15T15:41:46Z;If the data from outside that goes into the blockchain has to be honest, it's all over at that point. You are trusting people and might as well use a normal database that will be more efficient. Useless application for blockchains.;Amoeba;0;
UgxxLUIoyqV7NbbJWXB4AaABAg;2018-10-15T15:45:52Z;"Why would any company want all their data stored in a way that it is accessible by anyone including their competitors? Also data protection laws require companies to protect the data of their users from others so using blockchain is not possible in the first place.

In my oppinion blockchain for companies only works with data that they have to or are willing to share anyways like your WallMart example. But even then why use a blockchain when you can use much easier systems like a website to publish that data?

Another issue I see with blockchain is the human factor. Humans make errors when entering data. What if false data are entered into the blockchain? Now I can never correct that mistake again because it is designed that you can't change data in the blockchain? Not very practicable. In a regular database the admin or others could correct it. What happens in case of WallMart if a meat producer accidentally enters data saying a shipment of meat is chicken when it actually is turkey? 

And don't even get me started on the much higher energy consumption of blockchains compared to other systems.

I am not saying blockchain is totally useless but its useful use cases are much more limited than the current hype suggests in my oppinion.";Konseq;0;

UgxxLUIoyqV7NbbJWXB4AaABAg.8mQu3fTpRzq8mVAgsSwP4K;2018-10-17T07:36:52Z;"A lot of stuff here to address. You make some valid arguments.
Data protection and blockchain are two topics that are hard to mix (but not impossible).


It's true that companies usually don't want to decentralize their business because that would put them out of work (like Kickstarter for instance). However that leaves the door open for others to do it. I can imagine that people passionate about open source would want to create decentralized alternatives to eliminate intermediaries.


Is publishing to a website easier? Absolutely! But it has its disadvantages. It's not distributes, there is a single point of failure and as a user you can't know if someone has tampered with the website.


The human factor is indeed an import factor and people will indeed make mistakes. The key here is to automate all of this to prevent people from making mistakes and to prevent tampering with data. The immutability doesn't have to be a problem. You can design a system that allows you to revise the data by adding updates to your blockchain. Something similar to what IPFS does.


The energy consumption is something that is being actively worked on. This is a property of the proof-of-work algorithm. Alternatives like Proof-of-stake are much more energy efficient.";Simply Explained;1;
UgyfD3HD1WK3bDpVDdV4AaABAg.8mQtabfWiIB8mVAuA_Nthk;2018-10-17T07:38:41Z;Yep, you can always tamper with the data before it goes into a blockchain. But you can minimize that risk by automating it as much as possible. You can use sensors to automatically insert certain events (like GPS location for instance). Additionally a blockchain is distributed and prevents people from tampering with data. Something you can't easily do or guarantee with a regular database.;Simply Explained;0;

UgyOFTGW3txaO8N_wy94AaABAg;2018-10-24T10:04:29Z;This is so strange. I have watched tons of videos on blockchain and as a programmer it took watching this video in code language for this to be fully understood. Hilarious that english seemed more obtuse than pure javascript code to explain this concept. I even can now extrapolate how to write a code for correcting a chain after a change (iterating with a method that will match various tags ie timestamps etc) and also even how a proof of work might function. Great video I think aimed directly at coders.;TALKBACKWORLD;0;

UgyunvqSDGnOEcpAZJZ4AaABAg.8mpIt21CVu18mpXzZOuIrF;2018-10-25T14:44:26Z;Private and public key are both unique. The public key is freely shareable with anyone. It's the address of your wallet. The private key on the other hand is used to sign transactions. It proves that the owner of the wallet is taking money out of it. It should be kept secret so only you can spend your coins.;Simply Explained;2;

The main goal of environment variables in Serverless is to not have to include sensitive data in your code.

UgwYN4cpOE9Ve8Xr2XV4AaABAg;2018-10-30T15:03:40Z;"Dude, can you explain how one can protect himself from this? You didn't, actually. You've just advised to install something, but didn't describe how the 'something' works. For example, what role 'no third-party cookies' setting plays here? Assume, it blocks third-party cookies, but does it block also third-party cookies I've already accepted (like facebook cookies, which are third-party, but if you are logged in, they already present in your browser)? I mean, if you have your facebook cookies and visit a website with facebook 'share' button, will 'no third-party cookies' setting block any _changes_ in cookies if these changes were requested not by a website you are currently on or will it just allow any changes for these third-party cookies, because you've already accepted them for facebook and have some of them in your browser? Or this works another way? Like, when facebook code inserted into a website, facebook can get the URL of the website when you send some requests from the website, and when it happens, your cookies stay unchanged, but facebook gets your authentification info and gets URL of the website you're currently on and just writes this into the database?

How _technically_ one can protect himself from cookie tracking? I have EditThisCookie extension, but I'm not sure it can do something about that - because I do not understand how it works. Because if cookie shouldn't be necessarily changed for this, protecting them with the extension will do nothing. In that case one can only protect himself if he blocks such requests from non-related websites completely, I assume.";–ó–∏–≥–º—É–Ω–¥ –ö—Ä—é–∫–≤–∞;11;

I give you opened trezor and only I knows combination to open it once its closed. So after you close it you cant open it again, anyone can .. only me because I have a key/combination.

Verifying transactions is something else. To do that, the miner checks that each transaction was signed with the correct keys (eg the key of the person who sends the money). It also checks if that person has a high enough balance to make that transaction.

Thanks so much for the video which really simple and very easy to understand the basic concept

in the bitcoin transaction will have only the ""From"" (Sender), ""To"" (Receiver) and ""Amount"" 

(amount of bitcoin to be send) data.

how the blockchain node update the amount of bitcoin in the sender and receiver wallet?

UgznyoYw3qPYAoYHt9N4AaABAg.8nwAk5wnqdt8nz__fkROwQ;2018-11-23T08:50:55Z;I agree with you that sometimes governments impose regulation that are too strict. They can indeed hurt innovation. In case of privacy however I think we're in need of strong regulation. Especially if you consider recent events surrounding Facebook (as an example). Collecting a ton of personal data without properly informing users is not acceptable.;Simply Explained;1;
UgwBWtdkDZROEUzg9JZ4AaABAg.8nvwUQCYH6-8nz_oz6vM4p;2018-11-23T08:53:01Z;Yes. Imagine you want to transfer me some money but you don't have a direct channel with me.

UgypCnBg6PjjZA9Pjqd4AaABAg.8nut5hE8fzL8nza8nq_Ecz;2018-11-23T08:55:51Z;Very good question (I should've addressed this in the video). The idea here would be that you create a new entry on the blockchain every time you update the data on the server. You could even keep track of the versions on the server (so all hashes in the blockchain remain valid for as long as the data is there).;Simply Explained;1;
Ugxc4bqenl5QIn-cs8Z4AaABAg.8nxnhCKs5yP8nzaCwjgplw;2018-11-23T08:56:25Z;The data inside a blockchain is completely open. It's very secure, just not private.;Simply Explained;0;
UgwAoJqBQIJ3I55nNbd4AaABAg.8nxieFJcD888nzaRWQkjD2;2018-11-23T08:58:25Z;I partially agree with you. Governments should be careful when they introduce restrictive laws because they can have a bad effect on innovation. However, in this case I make an exception. Our privacy is being violated left and right while users have no real rights to prevent this from happening. The industry has brought this on themselves and I believe GDPR is actually a step in the right direction. But it's definitely not perfect either.;Simply Explained;2;

Storing large data offchain is the solution for a blockchain dApp because of these reasons:
- difficult to query 
- it will be of heavy size leading to too many big data centres in future.
- existing data can't be changed but modified.
That's why it is definitely the way to bring decentralization.

Why not assign blocks to users by scaling the size of their stake with the transaction value of the block? So have some sort of sliding scale where somebody with a smaller stake will get blocks of smaller transactions, and somebody with a larger stake will get blocks of larger transactions, kind of like tax brackets. And arrange it so that everybody (having over a relatively small stake in the currency) gets roughly the same amount of blocks to process.;Pining for the fjords;0;

If you buy gpu you can start mining right now with your PC, thats decentralization . Ones who can be validators and need to be elected its pretty much central cuz it prone tu manipulation. And we know they have influence cuz they are developers so they can take money from treasury when ever they wan. How .... they provide node delegates-nodes-pool owners with some generous airdrops for ordinary ppl to vote for them so you get small that he can get a lot.

Just look at how they regulate food or drugs for instance, or even polluted corporate behaviors. There's hypocrisy all over the place in their ""regulations"". They're also good at ignoring the science on a range of issues, e.g. when science shows we need to switch over the green tech ASAP.

None of what you're proposing makes a lick of economical sense. Look at all the data associated with your food example. That would create an insane amount of overhead to have that sort of data input for every single piece of food. It's completely unfeasible. And even if it wasn't how would that help if the consumer pays for that food with cash. And going the other way - using credit/debit or any other traceable currency then you open yourself up to being datamined in everything you do. Yeah, that's a hard pass thanks. Not all technology is a boon or benefit to mankind. It's pretty easyt to argue that most of them are the antithesis of that, and this is certainly one of them.

UgyKjCwAzLMP4gCVRxh4AaABAg;2018-12-21T06:37:42Z;Correct me if I'm wrong but the whole point of PoW is that it's hard to get the right hash but super easy to verify it.  So my question is even if one pool owned 51% of the hash power literally as soon as they post the false hash as a solution it can be checked to be known as false so I don't see how they could fake it.  Also I don't understand how you even could fake it if a hash consists of previous data from the block chain and new transactions ran though a hash algorithm doesn't faking a hash also fake a transaction?  And if so since things like public and private keys exist on wallets no one can fake that you sent money except you so again wouldn't this be super easy to verify as false once the hash is posted? As immediately you can run the hash and be like hey uh this transaction didn't use the correct private and public key combo this is fake.  Point is it's already hard enough to fake it and then by PoW's very nature it's super easy to tell a fake/bad hash from a real one.  I agree that the amount of power miners for bitcoin use is ridiculous and not scale-able at all in terms of how much power is used and how many transactions are added to the ledger.  But once bitcoin halves for the last time and other coins stop having block rewards through inflation miners will be getting paid through transactions fees at that point anyway, PoS as it stands just seems like a half baked solution imo, especially considering that most coins that use it don't have much market cap preventing someone from getting 51% of it.;FSC 89;0;
UgzkBwimDCYfqTkevE14AaABAg.8iTVQPhshHB8p6Sbz2dpwH;2018-12-21T06:46:39Z;Fun fact you'd probably like it's highly likely Satoshi didn't create bitcoin and isn't who he says he is. Him being from Japan makes zero sense when you compare it to the original code of bitcoin and his forum posts, the way the notes are written in his code and the slang he used was indicative of that of someone who lives in the UK or europe.  Also his original forum posts fall in a time frame that would be most common for someone living in europe if he was living in japan while developing bitcoin that would mean that he was up making posts during really weird hours of the day even on weekends and weekdays;FSC 89;0;

UgypooxPGTjctkGJ2_Z4AaABAg;2018-12-25T07:01:49Z;"Thanks for sharing.  I am a professional embedded SW developer and SpaceX enthusiast; so, I had been curious about their code.  
I was glad to hear they use Unix and that they don't use Python (the horrible preferred choice of a lot of Mechanical types).

I am a seasoned C++ programmer and do like that choice; but, I think a managed programming language like C++ of Java might have some advantages. 
 C++ is a loosely constrained language and is also un-managed; so, it can be more difficult to find subtle bugs (like unassigned pointers, and memory leaks) and much more dangerous when you miss them.  There are techniques for limiting this; but, programmers are still people and they can make and miss mistakes and testing every possible code path is often not possible.  
I am sure the developers on the Ariane 5 did lots of testing and still somehow missed the code bug that caused the failure.  
Anyone that claims their code is 100% bug free is either deluding themselves, lying, or not looking.  I am not really sure which one of those is worse.

The advantage of C++; though, can be better real-time determinism.  With UNIX and C++ on an X86 core, one project I was on achieved sub-microsecond determinism.
At the speeds they are flying, that may be the bigger concern.  There are ways to build more safety of C++ code, especially if they don't use other people's libraries.

UgwmTZglzU4RYx6JyLB4AaABAg.8ocA0Nh9oo88pbaZAAC2FU;2019-01-02T18:20:28Z;Depending on the type of radiation you are trying to absorb it can take a non-trivial amount of water to do so. You can't just put a thin layer on there and call it good. Also, water sloshes around and on something like a rocket you don't want any off-axis sloshing, so if you have a non-trivial amount of water you have to keep it very tightly contained. And now you run into some other problems... depressurization, as you go into orbit, will cause expansion and boiling of the water, so it must be contained within a pressure vessel, and the computer. Which makes it a pain in the butt to do any sort of repairs on, and you have to worry about another pressure vessel for every single processor. And you have to heat it because water tends to freeze at -248 C. So you have added orders of magnitude of complexity and numerous additional failure points. So no... you don't just coat the damn computer in water at all.;mycroft16;0;

The masses do not really care how things works as long as it works. Do majority of you really care how the website you visit works,how YT works, how your apps works? Some people will, but a lot of people do not care. Even if the tech they're using is secure or not, they only hope it is. Why do we still use these techs? Bcoz its all mass adopted,its convenient even we dont know how all of these works. So buy other altcoins you want that is faster than bitcoin, or for whatever reason. Just always remember, the techs that are always mass adopted are the one who is backed by major players, as of now, its bitcoin. No not XRP, XLM,but I dont know if someday they will be adopted.

Satoshi ""who is either a group or people or one person with a fake name"" is just the man who made Bitcoin. He made a few transactions and mined for a bit as a proof of concept and everyone else ran with it. 
He then went into hiding, but we still have information of his transactions so we know whatever Satoshi Nakamoto was he was on the blockchain and he made transactions and that's all a blockchain should tell you about a person. 

Wanting the Blockchain to assist in having people pay their taxes is an evil thing to suggest. Taxes are mandatory but Bitcoin nor blockchains were made so it could serve the IRS. 

Bitcoin is based on scarcity. The amount of whole coins that could possibly be missing that Satoshi personally mined is irrelevant when fractions of a bitcoin are worth hundreds of dollars.";Phoebe Aurum;0;

UgxXJnYwmIfDjV3D0rp4AaABAg.8q5ft4wF1t68q5gqcF_kXX;2019-01-14T20:11:53Z;"Dominik Sosnowski in the example you‚Äôre trying to prove to your friend that the balls are a different color. So asks you a question that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to reliably answer if the balls were the same color - you would just have to guess. But because they are a different color, you don‚Äôt have to rely on guessing. Think of it like this - if someone asked you to guess a number between 1 and 10, you have a 10% chance of being right. But if you knew for a fact that the number was 7, then it wouldn‚Äôt even require guessing.

The probability goes from 1/2 to 1/4 because when you‚Äôre determining the probability of getting the right answer for repeated events, you multiply the probability of the individual events together. In this case, the probability for the first and second event are both 1/2 (50% chance of getting the right answer by guessing), so the chance of getting it right both times is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4
This probability gets successively lower by repeating the event more times.";Noah McCann;0;
UgzgB2423v59xGWbl1V4AaABAg;2019-01-14T20:16:14Z;"I really liked the example using color blindness, it was a neat solution. An alternative to repeating the shuffle and question process to get higher probability of correctness would be to cut a piece out of one ball, then cut up the other ball into many pieces, then mix the pieces in such a way that the person doing the mixing knew where the one piece was, while the person asserting that the balls are a different color does not. This is more destructive, and more complex, but possibly faster if you needed high probabilities of correctness quickly.

As many other comments have said, I‚Äôd be interested in further videos on this topic.";Noah McCann;0;

So we talking about a lower probability of me lying about the color cause for the color blind friend it doesn't matter what's the color but he cares about the biggest probability of me telling the correct answer?;Dominik Sosnowski's Channel;0;
UgxXJnYwmIfDjV3D0rp4AaABAg.8q5ft4wF1t68q6-Ib8c9Kc;2019-01-14T23:01:51Z;"Dominik Sosnowski precisely. In the example, your friend is already skeptical of your answers. But the probability of you correctly guessing the right answer goes down with each repetition of shuffling the balls around and asking for your guess. The only way that you could be right every time after a large number of repetitions is that you aren‚Äôt guessing - you‚Äôre using some additional information to inform your answer. In this case, that additional information is knowledge about color.

Now, something the video doesn‚Äôt touch on is the fact that you could be using knowledge other than color - for instance maybe you‚Äôre able to see behind his back by using a reflection. Or maybe you know that your friend will do a certain shuffle order - thus not being completely random and giving you a slight advantage above and beyond the 50/50 odds one would expect. The example assumes randomness and what kind of knowledge you have access to.";Noah McCann;1;

If someone kept knowing exactly what you did to the balls, how long would it take you to believe that they are different?
You see them both as the same but he always knew what you did behind your back...
What are the chances he guessed it right 5 times? Still not sure? Go for 10... even 20... do you still think he guessed it 20 times? What are the chances he guessed correctly 20 times?
There is almost no way someone can guess something 20 times or even 10 times in a row.. the probability of him doing so is extremely small.

Editing a past block does nothing because referencing it for a new transaction will instantly make it invalid to all the other nodes.  Nodes only need to validate past blocks once, and the proof of work ensures it has been unchanged. Each new block mined makes all previous blocks more secure.  Each node keeps an identical running tally of all unspent transactions (called the UTXO set) - from this, it is easy to figure out how much bitcoin is contained in addresses associated with any particular wallet.;SAL;0;

They will get commited by a miner when his mining is succesful. Did I understand it correctly? Why could a miner not change the transaction before the mining is complete and therefore no hashing for the particular transactions is established at this point?";Kevin Heusinger;0;

I lost a lot of money and way more than half the value of my BTC which I purchased at $9,428. I was devastated and got desperate seeking options to recover my loss when I stumbled upon James Long on youtube. After considering the odds, I contacted him via mail, and the result was life-changing. That's when I realized that it is ok buying loads of coins for a future that could moon or completely dip and cost you your Holding. Well, I couldn‚Äôt lose any further cos I wasn‚Äôt HODling again and I also chose to try out James Long's signals. He gave me a basic understanding of the benefit of trading over holding especially in a speculative market. He then provided me with his daily signals and trading patterns, and within a month, I was able to make almost 600% on my Bitcoins. James Long never asked me to give him access to my account, you can always join the winning team of a more experienced trader with already working and proven strategy. If you have any inquiries, you can reach him on *(jameslong241 @ Gmail. com)* and gain reliable profit with your little experience in crypto.;Kyleigh Ritter;8;

UgzF-gtp-Lw8xocilTN4AaABAg;2019-03-10T19:35:37Z;"What meaning has the smart property concept for cars? Ok, car has it's own ID shared with the network (something like colored crypto coin) and the owner also knows the private key associated with it. ID is based on the digital certificate of manufacturer, so anybody can verify that the car was really produced. But, if somebody really steals my car (physically), how can anybody verify that he just don't exchange the public key (car ID) as it will looks ok? Not stolen? How can I securely say that this car has this ID in the blockchain?

I understand advantages of blockchain ""unchanbeability"", but tokenization of car keys to coins doesn't make sense.

Imagine this situation. You have the petrol station and stolen cars can't use it. With blockchain you can find the same car ID and verify, that it have to be unlocked with the owner's private key. How can you prove that this car has this ID?

I thought about giving some serious disadvages of no private key. Ok, you can still destory the immobilizer or something like that, but the property is still in the blockchain under the other owner (verified by the having of private key). How can it be used against theft?

Or how everybody can verify, that exactly this car has been stolen? That's smarter than attemping to prevent theft at all.

Just "" you don't have the private key, so you can't shopping there, you can't use this road, you can't park here, you can't get the insurance etc. Why? Because you're a thief! You don't have the private key of this car."" This may be the revolution in the security of property..

Example. I stole car without using the private key. Just because of power. I destoried the car computer and replaced it with my own. How can now anybody verify that the car is stolen using the blockchain?

Or, anyway, it is not important? Why? Maybe because you catch the thief before he changes the look of car. Imagine he rides on the highway and the security camera takes a picture.

If the car has permanent internet connection, the car's network node has to be turned off while violent theft (!). The car's look is in the blockchain associated with the car's ID (I know that it will probably takes too much memory, but imagine). So, now  can anybody (using the camera) deduce that this car has probably broken security system because it's ID loses touch with the vehicle and nobody types the passworld. So it has been stolen.

Of course, because of pseudoanonymity nobody knows who has the keys in the real world.";Ivan Novotn√Ω;1;

UgxhDYyLdo_5vE3mjCJ4AaABAg;2019-03-14T23:14:31Z;"IPFS has a great epic privacy fail!

IPFS is a solution to get content from an computer near you to protect the long range internet data link and to reduce the latency of respondig. Rearly a great Idea!

But if yo can find content on computer near you, you can also determninate on wat computers a specific content was seen.
This is - depending on the content - enourmes privacy influencing.

The classic example: You are using products of the Adults Entertainment Industrie. Or you have see stuff, your goverment does not like you see ist. For example some Hints about Korruption of Erdogan in the Tukey. Or some History reports About the Amenias Holocaust in Turkey. Within the USA i dont know such exact, but looking Videos from Parties the USA is in War will it also create some Questions from Official sides?

To Bring IPFS to a success, it must include the privacy Ideas of IAN Clark's Freenet. For Example: the Chunks are Hashed, Then Encrypted with the Hash as Key and then a second time Hashed for Address creation. The Link is the concat of the both Hashes. This makes the Content Denieble. Wy there is a ""Privacy Mode"" in the Browser when you can look in the ipfs folder to check what was used?

But for Every Content you Know you can Calculate the Link. So the Data must be never stored at the related Computer to make IPFS rearly a private transport layer. And also it ist Important that the Content never comes direct from the source Computer. How to do this is all finaly evaluated in Ian Clark's Freenet. In Order to Avoid ""Cambridge Analytica"" by everyone, it is Madatory to include Ian Clarks privacy Ideas to IPFS

In other words, there is likely a ""users"" table, in the Fb database, which contains a boolean (True/False) or binary (0/1) column, titled ""active""(or something similar). When you create a Facebook account, this column will either be set as ""True"" (boolean) or ""1"" (binary). When you delete your account, the boolean/binary value will simply be flipped (to either ""False"" or ""0""). This merely tells the Facebook program not to display the user's information any longer, since the account is no longer active.

Ugw8eYmILGItnJ7dG_N4AaABAg.8a7poPX-UfV8sbUK2GEjqa;2019-03-18T06:51:25Z;"- Bitcoin network is decentralised and it is true Peer-to-Peer system
- Lightning network is centralised and is not Peer-to-Peer system
- Bitcoin miners are not acting as money transferring entities, this is why they cannot be regulated
- Lightning network uses Hubs which do act as money transferring entities, and have to be regulated

So in short, Bitcoin system is one that no bank or government can control or regulate while Lighting they can (and will).

When Bitcoin Core developers who are employees of corporation Blockstream, who are funded by bankers, give reasons as to why Bitcoin cannot scale on-chain, they are literally lying, an the real reason they are doing this (preventing increase of block size which is artificially kept by them at 1MB) is because the people that fund them (tens of millions of dollars) are the only people that have to lose (their power and control over supply of money) - the bankers.

Bankers have tried to kill Bitcoin as it is threat to their power and control.
Bankers realised they cannot do this externally.
Bankers then did what they always do, buy out people who have control of the code, and let them do the dirty work for them

Bitcoin Core developers have successfully prevented more scaling on Bitcoin layer, they use censorship and propaganda against anyone that exposes their lies and secret agenda (which I just outlined). Just head to r/bitcoin (heavily censored controlled by Blockstream associates and pro-Bitcoin BTC) and you will see what I mean.

The Bitcoin system is actually BSV

BTC is literally a SCAM now and no longer works as Bitcoin system should and Lightning has absolutely NOTHING to do with Bitcoin.";Kuky;3;

UgwrJy69QWcLd6CkKkd4AaABAg;2019-03-23T19:47:34Z;"I feel like the explanations are a bit over simplified, so here's my take on it.

There are 4 items: the document, a box, a lock, and a key.

The box is the encryption algorithm that uses the lock to encrypt the document and create the decryption algorithm.

The lock and key are the public and private keys. I call them the lock and key because of how they're used.

You have your sensitive document that needs to be sent, and your friend sends the box and key. The box is something that everyone can get and probably didn't need to be sent since you might already have one, but the lock is specific to your friend.
You put your document in the box, lock it, and send it for them to unlock it.

Bam, I just summarized this in a way the included the actual algorithm and doesn't use the phrase ""public key.""";George Cowsert;0;

UgxuloUBl42uOXdeF154AaABAg.8bEu0I8_hff8temjdRsitc;2019-04-13T10:10:12Z;Bitcoin Cash can process more transactions because nobody uses it, so it has capacity (for now). But Bcash can not scale until Visa because it would require a 100 GB block, which cannot be transmitted effectively every 10 minutes to all nodes. Lightning network is a long-term bet and it can truly scale without compromising security and decentralisation of the network. Bitcoin Cash is the wrong short-term fix.;vigilant_cat;0;
Ugw1AEU7iLs94oqJ9NV4AaABAg.8i8OOIXuYY28ten2uPWCe3;2019-04-13T10:12:58Z;You say Lightning Network risks centralisation but don¬¥t mention that scaling on-chain is guaranteed centralisation? In Lightning you can choose whatever route you want and the protocol is private because each node can only see one hop so is unable to tell where did the payment come from or where is it going.;vigilant_cat;0;

buying like 5 billions worth of mining equipment, setting up a mining farm and then starting to overtake the network takes months and might not be in time as you have to keep up with the hashrate increase.

Ugx5b7T0yBjYOnFXWQt4AaABAg.8YVLpCqHkRQ8uYXj7z0tdN;2019-05-05T11:07:01Z;"@MR9 Production Yes, this is right. Or you might think of it this way: in order for the block to be valid, it's hash (which includes the nonce in its input) has to start with at least a certain number of zeroes, and so the miner is guessing different nonces (it doesn't necessarily have to be incrementing starting from zero, you could also just generate random nonces to try, which I believe is what actually happens) until it finds one that results in a block hash that satisfies that requirement. 

Because the output of a hash function is more or less random, the chances that any given character in it is a specific number like zero is basically 1/16 (hashes are in hexadecimal, so 16 possible characters), which means on average you will have to try 16 nonces before you get a hash that starts with a zero (for example).  If you want it to start with two zeroes it should take about 256=16^2 tries with different nonces until you find one. A hashing function generally takes about the same amount of time to run every time, so if you have a certain length of time you want this process for generating a valid block hash to take, you can tune this by setting the difficulty -- the higher the difficulty (more zeroes at the beginning of your hash) the longer it will take on average to find one by randomly guessing the nonce. 

So just by showing the block, the correct nonce you found, and the resulting block hash that satisfies the current difficulty, you've actually proven that you spent a certain amount of time working on this problem. Because of the way hashing algorithms work, there's no way to cheat this -- you really can only find a valid hash by guessing nonces and testing them out, you can't start with a hash with a bunch of zeroes and reverse the process to find the nonce that generates it. This relies on the fact that the hashing algorithm uses some specific math that is impossible to reverse for all practical purposes (for Bitcoin it's the discrete logarithm problem).

That's why this is called proof of work! The mere existence of the block hash proves that you did a certain amount of work, because you couldn't have it without doing the work (or at least *someone* had to do the work to create it). And the beauty of this system is that it's very easy to check that the hash is valid, because you only have to take the nonce they found and do one hash of the block yourself -- if it matches the hash they gave, then you know it's valid.

All of this proof of work stuff is important because it makes it very hard to modify the blockchain. In order to modify a block, you have to generate proofs of work for that block and every block after it (since each one depends on the previous one, as shown in the video). Since by design a proof of work takes a long time to generate, the further back the block is that you're trying to change the more time it will take to find all those new hashes. Meanwhile, the honest miners are continuing to add blocks to the original, unedited version of the blockchain. Unless you are in control of most of the miners you will never catch up.

This is why the rule is to always trust the longest version of the blockchain if there is more than one, because ultimately the honest blockchain will always grow longer than your edited version. This is also why you should wait for a certain number of ""confirmations"" before trusting a transaction (a confirmation is just another block added on top of the one containing your transaction) -- maybe the hacker got lucky and found a valid hash really quickly once or twice for their malicious blockchain, but the chances they can keep this up for 6 or more blocks is basically zero.";R√©al Provencher;2;

UgzyffVWpSxTIJKYYGB4AaABAg;2019-05-07T14:33:27Z;There are a few factors, such as greater efficiency of PoS coins, its higher resistance against any kinds attacks as well as the growing popularity of this consensus which is dictated by a significant technological advantage over Proof of Work. That is why some currencies decide to conduct swap and resign from using PoW which is replaced by Proof of Stake. One of such coins is PrimeStone Coin (PSC) which conducted swap in January 2019. As a user I am more satisfied with PoS, because rewards for stakers come proportionally to the amount of possessed coins so it a fair solution. The situation with PoW was a bit confusing nd irritating. When sb put a huge comupting power and then switched it off, the chain was stuck. So I consider chains based on PoW less efficient and effective than PoS.;Lauri Gahan;0;

With POS a person can stake some or all of their holdings, making more of that particular digital currency...thus making their holdings grow in a safer way than POW.

So, I really hate when people start saying how this project is centralized more than this other project.....as the digital asset becomes developed further down the line (road map) the goal is for the project to become Decentralized. So, that argument is a weak one at best. It just really depends on at what stage in the development process is a particular digital currency at, at the moment. We are so early to this asset class, we are at the beginning of the development of ""internet of value"" that most digital currency/blockchain are not even close to what they will be like in 10 - 20 years from now.";Lord Wise;5;

UgzUlWXl5JIAHL7Si-B4AaABAg;2019-06-17T16:01:58Z;The error correction example you gave is completely bogus. Take your 5 7 and 19 example. Say you can only read the 5 and have an error correction of 31. That leaves 26 unaccounted for and two blanks to fill in. That then creates an array of potential values. So how then does one or the sequencer know which value is assigned to each blank? Also keeping in mind that the wrong value will alter the DNA and thus make the error correction of no value.;Sean Regehr;1;

UgzUlWXl5JIAHL7Si-B4AaABAg.8wHmeu9TcYZ8wHoabrFZCF;2019-06-17T16:18:51Z;"Hi Sean! Actually the example I gave is the most simple version of an error correcting code. This video was about DNA storage, not about error correcting code so I had to keep it short.
It's possible to add more redundancy with more advanced ""algorithms"" like Reed-Solomon encoding. And you're correcting when you say that my explanation won't work when a wrong value is read.";Simply Explained;0;
Ugw8MNNDs8PTZmtreXB4AaABAg;2019-06-17T16:21:12Z;"The problem with the approach you described is someone does not understand how DNA works.

There are two strands of data, likened to a male and female or positive and negative. The male/positive is the strand that is read and the female/negative is the strand that confirms the data is accurate.

Say each value in the strand is one of the following: 00, 01, 10, 11 and also holds up to 4 values or 8 digits (bits/bytes).

If the male/positive is 01, then the female/negative is 10; the exact opposite. Male 01, 01, 11, 00 & Female 10, 10, 00, 11 and totals has a total of 8 (11, 11, 11, 11). This yields two distinct strands that are complementary to each other and when totaled will always equal to 8. This also gives great error correction since any combined lines that have a total value of less than 8 one knows immediately that they have been tampered with or are incorrect, letting you know to perform error correction. Because both strands must be complementary all error correction is a simple math operation to recover. This is not hard nor very difficult, so long you one knows what they are doing.

Now on top of the basics, one could easily allow for new/different formats for various purposes, so long as they stick to the principles mentioned above. Change your total value from 8 to say 64 or 128, etc. It makes no difference other than some performance on massive data sets. Similarly one could nest the simple DNA strands within each other to make up massively complex DNA, similarly to nesting arrays within each other.";Sean Regehr;8;
UgzUlWXl5JIAHL7Si-B4AaABAg.8wHmeu9TcYZ8wHr8ncXwYO;2019-06-17T16:41:08Z;"@Simply Explained - One cannot talk about DNA storage without talking about error correction since that is the main benefit to DNA storage and also half of the story right there. See my second comment that accurately describes DNA storage. It also correctly shows how error correction is handled as it is vitally important to the DNA storage itself. No ""advanced algorithms"" are needed either unless one tries to make a mess out of the simplicity of DNA storage. But then that is a whole other beast.";Sean Regehr;0;

Now, if someone reads this, I have a question about one aspect that I am not too sure I understood correctly.
You said the mined amount will get added with the next mined block, but in reality that would be very counter productive, would it not? Otherwise, nobody could actually make any transactions, because all of the blocks are used up to pay the rewards...? Or am I missing something?";Christian Gr√∂ber;0;

And how would compression work on this network? We just all sending raw video files? 

Also wouldn‚Äôt it be more sufficient to have a big cashing database on mars instead of distributing it.

Without knowing if it is correct, I see the non-interactive zk-proof as something that is easily tested for truth rather than using a process to convince. For instance in the case of the color blind guy with the green and red ball, in that case it was interactive as you had to prove that you could see a difference. Imagine if the green ball was made of some magnetic material and the red was non-magnetic, you could easily prove the balls were different without the testing back and forth. This is a fact you easily can share with many other in the same situation.
I come to this conclusion as he says that blockchain have to use non-interactive proof to work and in the case with blockchains you don't have to show every nounce you where trying to show everyone you have a solution, only the last value that was a solution as it is a very easy computation for everyone to to test if it is true. I do see this is 100% sure though, and he keeps saying that with zk-proof you can never be 100% sure. I can't fit that part into my reasoning for non-interactive zk-proof...

Would this be a plausible explaination?";Robert Nystr√∂m;10;

You mean to say the hacker would fix this problem by changing the pointer to the newly generated hash code of the tempered block thus generating a new hash for the sucessor?That sounds to me like lots of effort, but assume someone manages it after a long time. The hacker now has a completely newly generated block chain as his own local copy. Now what? That copy is different from anyone elses...Basically I don't understand why a hacker would change his entire local block chain when his local copy ends up being different from the rest of the world";CrispyBacon;0;

The reason is simple: in a Blockchain network there has to be consensus. This is reached when 50% of all nodes on the network have the exact same copy of the blockchain. (Note that you can have a tampered version of the blockchain. Thats possible, but nobody will look at yours).

Back to the hacker. If it would be easy to tamper with blocks, he could convince 50% of the nodes on the network to conspire with him. In the end, they could steal a lot of coins and reap the profits. So that‚Äôs why breaking a blockchain is deliberately made difficult.";Simply Explained;1;

You could make a short extension cord that has the two wires and then put the clamp over one of the wires. Given the crap  I have lying around that's how I'd do it.

A cool little trick for measuring low currents is that you can wrap the wire you put the sensor through the sensor several times and then divide the resulting measurement by the number of loops you did.";mcdls5;2;

Nice project build. I love the idea of the usage over time in the way you store the data and figure out the ""Always On"" devices and account for them.


To get real voltage, you could add AC circuit that reads the voltage directly, then rectifies and outputs to power the esp. But you'd need to have an AC power brick, as the DC ones have been smoothed and/or are done digitally with no transformer. On my line, over the course of a day, my voltage can swing from 125VAC to 116VAC (US power), which can make big difference on power consumption. Right now I'm actually using 2 power bricks as it's still in prototype form.";Korishan;0;

The generation of private keys and their according public keys is just the same as rolling a bunch of dice. You can do this online or offline, and someone else can roll the same dice. The difference is that the chance of rolling the same dice as someone else is just astronomically low, like you‚Äôd spend more time than the age of the universe to find two that match up, which is called a hash collision.;Wim Van Renterghem;1;

UgxteFiC8JLnOPu6RLV4AaABAg.8yIYd8Y4ogO8yIuOP0Cvxt;2019-08-06T19:31:30Z;@Ram Ganesh Soma  Think about the private key as huge number which is randomly generated.

UgySSKGxX-L2eVb8ixt4AaABAg;2019-08-06T19:37:12Z;"The fact a person or individual can artificially inflate the value of the coin, by sending coins to a non-existent ""wallet"", should be a major red flag. Also in the case of illegal activities, what is to stop a person from destroying any evidence by destroying the coins and wallet so as not to be caught? Especially if they also find a way to artificially create the ""non-existent"" wallet they sent the coins to be destroyed, therefore re-gaining all the coins they ""lost"". This setup allows for the ""perfect crime"" since the individual can destroy all traces of evidence and then gain it back minus any trail.

Digital currencies may work but just like anything new, there are still bugs to sort out, mostly how people can and will abuse what is already there to do more than was intended. IMHO it should be impossible to send anything or transact with a wallet that does not exist. Also wallets themselves should be required to be validated by peers the same way the currency transactions are. This would help close a large loop and potential major security issue. The public ledger must be used for the wallet creation as well. Period.

The other thing is that a public ledger is of little value without being able to know for certain how is witness to which transactions. Consider a malicious person wishes to abuse the system, so they create their wallet and several others. The others then become their own personal witness to some transactions, supposedly giving validity to the transaction. Yet all they have done is setup a dummy wall around the transaction to conceal it from being flagged. How would any person know if in fact it is a valid transaction or not. This again also should be thought of in light of the above, an individual who abuses the current setup. Too little record keeping is the main issue and perhaps was left in intentionally. If banks that have been around forever would not operate in such a manner, then a wise person should logically ask themselves why would digital currency do away with what works? Just because you can do something does not signify that it is good to do it. They desired to have more animosity, yet that may well be the achilles heel. Time will tell..

IMHO digital currency was created to strip value from legitimate users and provide a means for illegal activities. This then ensures that the majority of valid legitimate users serve as the perfect cover for the illegal activities that go on. Reality is the fundamental changes made for digital currency is the issue. No one speaks of this, as if none can write any programs that will abuse the software ever, nor will they ever try to do so.

UgySSKGxX-L2eVb8ixt4AaABAg.8yIv26xewkW8yKJ-x5RZPX;2019-08-07T08:34:36Z;"Coin burning is sometimes a good thing (especially to get rid of undistributed coins after an ICO) but I agree with you that it should not be used to inflate the value. But this is not unique to cryptocurrencies. Artificial inflation is happening right now, as central banks believe that it's necessary to maintain growth.

Small note: ""coin burning"" doesn't mean ""to destroy coins"". It simply means that you send them to a wallet of which nobody can obtain the private key. So you can't use this mechanic to perform ""the perfect crime"". The coins are still there and there is a record of you transferring coins to it. Also: there is no point in transferring your crime money to a wallet of which you cannot obtain the private key.

I don't agree that the creation of wallets should be changed. It's part of what makes cryptocurrencies so flexible (and also so secure). You can essentially hold coins and send transactions while being completely airgapped or without access to the internet.

About your witness statement: in most blockchains each transaction is still verified by the entire network, so it's pretty hard to beat that system. Other systems have special algorithms to randomly select a smaller amount of people to verify your transactions (which in theory you can't influence). Also: each transaction on a blockchain is digitally signed and this signature can be used to verify that the transaction originated from the person who has the private key of a wallet. So that's pretty secure as well. But I do agree with you that most software has flaws that can be exploited. Nothing is perfectly secure.

As for your comment about ""stripping value from legitimate users"": it depends. I do indeed see quite a few projects that are only interested in grabbing as much money as they can. Other projects really aim to build a replacement to our fiat currencies. Can it be used for criminal activities? Yes. But that's also the case with currencies today.

There is just two small bugs:
1) in the constructor of your block you call calculateHash before setting the nonce, which will be then undefined. Overall, I wouldn't call calculateHash in constructor as you will anyway overwrite it inserting it in the chain.
2) in your mining function, you first increment nonce, then you calculate your hash so you will never test the case with nonce = 0";Yohan Courbe;0;

I'm convinced LN will work with full custodial services, but in that case it's not really that different from using a bank. A bank is useful, but just as a regular bank one day you might just find out your bank is insolvent.

It can work for advanced users, which are willing to invest in running a full node, but that use case doesn't look too promising to me.

It is just not going to work for ""regular users"" on a non-custorial way, because on crappy user hardware it's too easy to lose the latest state of the channel.

Lastly if it's expensive to open and close channels, those expenses are going to have to be repassed to users hiring the custodial service.

Lastly, I'm not yet convinced once LN starts to see having heavy use, it's not gonna have tons of liquidity and deadlock problems on routes. Did I mentioned that opening and closing routes might still be pretty expensive?";Diogo V. Kersting;0;
Ugy3LnZz-68OS1ZSjhN4AaABAg.8xFqkd7BoDA8ynXWvSZeiZ;2019-08-19T02:18:39Z;"@Diogo V. Kersting LN *can* work with custodial services, just like how a blockchain setup can - but in either case, that doesn't mean it has to work with custodial services.  In other words, users can still be their own banks while using lightning.  It is already possible to manage your own lightning channels on an SPV node on your own smart phone (which is the only hardware that's needed in such a setup).  The channels can be managed automatically by the wallet software.  The latest state of any channels can be backed up in any number of ways (using a node running at home, a cloud service, a watchtower service, etc).  To address potential liquidity problems, we are already seeing the development of non-custodial ""loop-in"" and ""loop-out"" services.  As for ""deadlocks"" during routing, it isn't a big problem and it is very easy for the wallet software to immediately try a different route.  I have been using lightning for over a year now, and some of my channels have remained open since then.";SAL;0;

UgxJ5Xb7Yz_pVkwCZgR4AaABAg;2019-09-02T17:58:34Z;Solid video, but I think you overlooked a fundamental quality of gold that historically made it a good store of value: gold is very stable, and doesn't react with much or corrode easily, and while it's easy to work it or melt it down, it's very difficult to totally destroy or rust away. Likewise with silver, although it tarnishes easier than gold. Stability, probably more than any other quality, is prized in currency and stores of value, and that's why Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency's) volatility makes it anathema to being adopted widespread. That volatility, though, is what makes it attractive to people looking to make a quick buck, so it may be a while before it settles down.;Bercilak;1;

Here in North America and Europe we're a little spoiled with our stability. It's also very easy to transport (even across borders) and has other perks that Gold, Silver and fiat just don't have.


Ex: If I need to buy something for $15000 in cash (like a boat), what are my choices? The bank limits me to $2500 per day, so I can wait a week and get them to get my cash ready. Or I can do a cheque... which has similar clearing times. Or I can do an eTransfer... which also has daily and weekly limits. So I should pay by credit card?... which also has fees. Honestly, it doesn't feel like I have much immediate control over ""my"" money.


Crypto though - login, enter receiver's address, click button. A few moments later the funds are transferred and the network makes it irreversible. You can do it on the spot with the goods in front of you, then take ownership of them.

How do they know it's a good one, it's new. I was left with more questions than answers. Who creates the hash.   How can I make legitimate changes to the blockchain if the hash cannot be changed. Who (specifically) approves changes to the hash. How does the new hash become part of the block chain. How often is the blockchain updated with the new or modified hashes. Thew way you describe it it's nearly impossible to make changes to the block chain.   I am not being fair. This is a very basic overlook of block chain.

It will choose the chain with the highest cumulative difficulty. So for example if there is a chain with three blocks, each having 200 of difficulty, and another chain with five blocks having each 30 of difficulty, the first one will be picked.

It can prevent attackers to mine a longer chain with artificially lower difficulty in order to get the longest one and to be accepted by the network as the ""true"" chain.
Also, it's very unlikely that two concurrent chains have the same cumulative difficulty. It's so unlikely that the problem will probably never happen. Having two chains of the same length though, is much more likely.";ImAFlyingPancake;1;

It's disappointing that the FileCoin folks felt the need to build their own blockchain, even though it's understandable, seeing as the people in control of the main Bitcoin repository refused to allow the network to scale.

The DAO had a vulnerability that allowed people to do something multiple times without a variable being set.
Basically, the DAO did this:

(Dao Function) {
Check for true
Unsafely transfer ether
Set check to false
}

In Ethereum, when you send a regular transaction to a DApp, it triggers a function.
That was what the attacker used.

He took out some ether to a smart contract. The attacker smart contract, when the transaction
was sent said ""Hey, trigger that same function again""

So because the setting of the cooldown came AFTER the action, he withdrew again. The attacker did this
hundreds of times, until it ran out of gas.";CDR Systems;0;

in these decentralized blockchains everyone is equal.

Bitcoins!"". The code IS the currency, so there isn't some sort of secret code or other stuff.";CDR Systems;1;

Now if you tried to sign without that private key, it would not be a mathematically valid signature.  Such fake transactions would be instantly noticed by the nodes of the network and disregard, and if by some chance it is included in any block, that block is immediately noticed to be invalid and it will not be included in the blockchain.  All nodes on the bitcoin network are checking every bit of data.;SAL;0;

So, asymmetric encryption is just to exchange ciphers, certificate and server public key to client.

After that, that symmetric key used to encrypt data for that session. This process repeat for every flows.;Selvakumar Ramasamy;0;

Though I have a very minor clarifications though.
Why is it that you invoked calculateHash() inside addBlock() where in fact calculateHash() is already been initialized to the 'Hash' property in the Block constructor? I cannot think of any reason why there's a need to re calculate the Hash in the addBlock() method.

UgwAbRo0Xl1Cm2xVO2Z4AaABAg;2019-11-07T07:56:01Z;"gold was always being used in the industry, because there is no cheaper equilavent of it's properties. 
low melting point, easy to shape, stable and non toxic etc...
you may get gold and make a tool for human use, which would be impractical to make from other elements.


if someone needs it, might be ready to pay you by food to get that tool. this gives the intrinsic value of gold. 

the rest of the value comes from being rare and bull market. shininess has a very small portion in it's value.


for ex;
people use gold for dental prosthesis, because it's a statue symbol today. but until a generation ago, it was really required.
immune to corrosion, mimics the hardness of a real teeth. simply there was no cheaper equilavent to replace it. people needed it for medical reasons. not just to show off. 


even today, if we stop using gold or just remove gold from the earth, we may not have this micro processors anymore, cannot even mine crypto currency. we are using gold inside our microprocessors, because of it's conducting capabilities and there is no cheaper equilavent of this. 
if we use only copper in microprocessors, it will generate much more heat and may melt itself down. I can show you billions of people, would be ready to pay by food or real estate for  having a microprocessor which built properly with gold conductors. 


so I recommend you, be careful while talking about gold doesn't have any intrinsic value.";cagatayto;0;

Just an example, my IPFS node I'm running to host a small website (approx. 18MB)  is permanently talking with like 5000 peers and ""wasting"" on average 1Mb/s of my bandwidth.

For the example in the video, hash codes are demonstrated to be utterly unique in order to act as a primary key for identifying a block. By changing a block's hash, you don't invalidate the block, you just give it a new identity.
Now, this becomes important because as part of a block's validation process it must look at the block before it to ensure a consistent chain. In this case, B2's hash is changed, so when B3 looks for its previous link, B2, it can't find it because the hashes are different. B2's unique hash is *different* from *B3's memory* of B2's unique hash.

So why does this make B3 and subsequent blocks invalid, not B2? Well, the validation requires that *all* links of the chain remain consistent until they find the original, B1. In the example, B2 could still find B1. B1's hash didn't change. B3 however, couldn't find B1 because it couldn't find B2. And if B3 can't find B2, B3 can't find B1. This goes on for every block after B3 aswell. Ergo, B4 can find B3, but if B3 can't find B2, then B4 can't find B1.";Sentient Software;3;

UgyRO6Rw8bs9_lg4Stl4AaABAg;2019-12-14T15:53:08Z;"Nice job. 
only one question.
In your codes, as I checked, you set previous Hash by creating a block.
Suppose that, ""L"" is the current last block in a chain. Block ""A"" and ""B"" are created at the same time. So they set their previous hash with the same hash e.g. Hash of ""L"".

What happens by mining when both of them are mined successfully, but B was mined faster. 

Therefore normally the previous hash of ""B"" is correct, but the previous hash of ""A"" should be changed to the hash of ""B"".

What I want to reach, I think assigning previous hash by creating a block is not necessary, but by mining. Am I right?";Masoud Khoda;0;

UgxXaUrmmDK0XSiJYK94AaABAg;2020-01-12T06:32:51Z;Amazing explanation. One thing I fail to understand is the hash system. Is that a simply a random crypto code? What keeps one from simply copying the hash and validating it that way? I mean, you recalculated the hash, but the sha256 now has different data to stringify so I suppose the hash inevitably will become different, but what prevents you from copying the hash?;Detteermiig;0;
UgykFSTBkdNqJc0a_p14AaABAg;2020-01-12T06:34:20Z;Also, if they're never deleted, wouldn't this cause an enormous strain on the server capacity through accumulation? All information is copied, distributed to an entire network (copied each time) and never deleted? Sounds like room for disaster.;Detteermiig;0;
UgxXaUrmmDK0XSiJYK94AaABAg.93fvfT8EVj393fxuzrN2au;2020-01-12T06:52:26Z;"Oh, I get it! The for-loop calculates the hash as well! So it can only really match with either the current block or the next block, but never both! But only because the hash function produces a specific ID for the change in data.

I guess you'd need to be sure that the block validator has the exact same hash function (eg sha256) as the block creator then.";Detteermiig;0;
Ugxp-qXvHSaGtmtqHbB4AaABAg.93GWdgEDKAx93gXL4Bd5F0;2020-01-12T12:10:43Z;Yes, centrally managed blockchains are corruptible.  That is why I stick to just using the bitcoin blockchain.;plasticman2011;0;
UgwElo4E2KlwjEw9l0Z4AaABAg.93D5hagXbpe93gXcGMssue;2020-01-12T12:13:11Z;On the surface it looks that way, but it is actually something much more impactful.  The bitcoin blockchain is an immutable global ledger secured by proof of work mining.;plasticman2011;2;
UgwcFL06NLwX7zp0pjJ4AaABAg.92hrBYqNAxu93gXqkEF59z;2020-01-12T12:15:10Z;It also depends on the previous block because each block must contain parameters based on the previous block.;plasticman2011;0;

If the Fed, bank of England, and every other national financial institution decided to sell their gold, it probably wouldn't hold it's value for long, despite being used in various technologies.

But when you're mining a new block you are the one generating it, so you have to come up with a nonce for the new block on your own. And that requires guessing and checking over and over until you find a nonce that works -- every miner is doing this at the same time so it's a race to see who finds a working nonce first. And whoever does gets to claim the block reward, which for Bitcoin is currently 12.5 BTC for every block, but it goes down over time.


As for the difficulty, it is automatically tuned by the Bitcoin protocol itself. At a set interval (about every two weeks), the protocol checks the average time it takes to add a new block and increases or decreases the difficulty to try to bring that average closer to the target time (10 minutes for Bitcoin). So that is a completely automated process.";R√©al Provencher;0;

UgzuB7s0GXIdY5SrzmN4AaABAg;2020-03-02T13:21:13Z;"I think I read that the minimum POS for ETH is 32 ETH.  Right now it's at $226 USD, so I would have to sink $ 7,232 just to become a validator.  This seemingly is NOT a way for the average cryptopeep to gain entry.  I could continue buying enough to be ""competitive"", e.g., 50 ETH for $ 11,300 USD.  But do the validators know what the total number of validators in the group? 



So then, I have 50 of my ETH in the stake ""bank"" but the big money have a lot more and I get nothing in return.  I haven't seen a contract form that will guarantee I will get my 50 ETH back, or that the POS could get hacked, etc. Even if everything is working fine, my ETH is locked up until ETH releases it.  If ETH price drops 50%, I can't sell.  Definitely looks too risky for me but not for the whales who could probably take a Capital Loss on their US income tax.

Ugjc5fzREBWQDXgCoAEC.8V4VT8L78AI96-Bo1k5082;2020-03-09T20:30:09Z;"If you have CarOptions implementing Valuable, then the statement
myTesla = new RearFacingSeats(myTesla)
will result in a Valuable
Then, if you want to further decorate your Tesla with EnhancedAutoPilot, how will you do this. You can change the constructor and accept a Valuable instead of a Car, so effectively you are then decorating a Valuable instead of a Car. I feel that misses the purpose of the Decorator Pattern where you dynamically extend an existing class without need to adjust that existing class. And a decorated Tesla should result in a Tesla again.
I would adjust the naming a bit, eg DecoratedCar instead of CarOptions

abstract class DecoratedCar extends Car
{
     car : Car;
     public abstract getDescription() : string
     // the abstract cost() method is not required here as that one is inherited from Car
}

class RearFacingSeatsCar extends DecoratedCar
{
      car : Car;               // might be the base car model or an already decorated car";karel8y;3;

Not using apple products either as their business model depends on data collection. Dont want to give the false impression that apple respects privacy. 

Braves reward system turns me off as it has partnered up with Uphold to make the reward system functional. Uphold demands user ID to create a wallet. It shouldnt be nessecary to give up sensitive data to transfer money online. I have heard there are ways to avoid using Uphold, but the issue is more how Brave encourage the user to perform bad privacy acts.

So I'm guessing Bob sent Alice his public key via letterbox. And Alice uses Bob's public key to encrypt message. Once the message gets to Bob, he uses his private key to open the message.
So a message sent to Bob (encrypted with Bob's public key) can only only be decrypted using his private key. Therefore if anyone wants to send Bob a private message, they have to use Bob's public key to do so.";noorur;0;

UgzA_oKbTThlilfGqgt4AaABAg;2020-04-01T13:20:14Z;"What I don't get is how they (Public Key and Private Key )cannot derive from  each other. 
For example :
If I send to Stewie
""1 2 3 ""
and his Public key transform my message to: 
"" 2 3 4  "" (add +1 to each value ).
Then , someone (Brian) who has Stewie's Public Key, won't need his Private in order to decrypt it . 
I mean if he (Brian) has his(Stewie's) Public key , he can see the algorithm and he can pretty much do the opposite to decrypt it . 
In this case he will make an algorithm that does [-1 to each value], so it will take ""2 3 4"" and decrypt my message to him.
The basic question here is how We can go from Plain Message -> Encrypted Message (Using Stewie's Public key) but we cant do the opposite .
How the Public Key can Encrypt a Message a certain way that it cannot Decrypt it after?";Peter Griffin;0;

Yes Cardano may indeed be a promising project and I have no doubt good things will come out of it but when it comes to its leader it is a complete disaster. There is a reason why Charles Hoskinson is hated by absolutely everyone who has ever worked with him, he is one of the most toxic people to be around of. How hypocrite can one be to come ask for more funding to finish the project when he has sold ICO funds when BTC was at the top, to be more precise their ICO funds were around 110,000 BTC. When selling at the top that was more than 400 million dollars, moreover, Hoskinson assigned himself 2.4 billion ADA. All of the research IOHK ever made including Hydra, IELE and KEVM research was funded by ICO money, now after three years of incompetency and failed attempts to get something to market this man dares to come and ask the Cardano community for more funding in order to finish the initial roadmap. First he removed IELE and KEVM now they removed Hydra from saying it is not necessary, hell no Charles, it was always part of the roadmap. How low can you go to act this way, after all the money you earned from this project. Three years you lied to your community, telling them Shelley is just about to be delivered and now you act like none of this shit happened, it is disgusting the way you act knowing there is no one to be accountable to.

Ugw0ZSyfeZ-Z6c_ultZ4AaABAg;2020-04-13T08:29:38Z;"Probably too old to get an answer, but worth a shot. I changed your implementation to make it so that a list of contributors' addresses are stored in the block along with how many hashes they calculated, which is used to divvy out the rewards. So in getBalanceFromAddress(), in each block, I check for that address in the contributor list and add an appropriate amount to their balance. Do you think this is a reasonable approach? 

I feel like there must be a more efficient way of getting the balance than looping through the whole chain... maybe getting your balance could be a special type of transaction, and if the code finds that, it could know that that's the most recent updated balance and just stop there?";Flash Trance;0;

UgxD1fz9j0lLAwbHeRJ4AaABAg;2020-04-15T19:57:38Z;To be honest, interface is nothing. It's just a way of saying something that means many things, exactly like the word 'drone', it means a continuous humming sound and yet it also means it's a named as well. That's where ignorance lies, yes from you people of today who have made words that make no sense whatsoever. How does something become whatever it means, and then it means many other things when the crappy word is already a known word, 'inter', as in interior, and face, as in a person's face, a door face, a car face, etc. Typical mixture of words that are already used to mean one logic when we talk and write. But to mix one known word with another is really confusing. And this interface is one of such confusing jargon added in the English literature that is going to cause problems, given that you already explained what it means. At first I had no idea what interface meant. I thought it means the image you see on a computer screen, e.g. like that of a software of which you work on, for example like Blender Foundation. But no, now you say that interface is a connection of a device to another device by cables, flash drive external drive, DVD drive, HDM to TV, etc. Waste of Time learning computer jargon in my opinion. If I am to connect a device to another device,  I just say, cables - as in HDMI cables, flash stick or usb drive cables, printers and other computer devices cables, each has a name for the connection of any devices, and cables, flash drives, etc., aren't interfaces. So, it's just the same with computer geeks, using words to make an unusual name for something that makes no sense whatsoever. The same with 'drone', it's a word that has present and past participles, one plural word and a number of definitions. So, how does it become a name to call shitty rc models and aircraft drones? Have you ever heard of names, such as John, Peter, Phillip, Stan, Mark, etc., ever had present/past participles and definitions? No, so, how does a word become a name, not just a name but how can it be used to name more than a dozen gadgets, including several flying pilotless military aircraft that the ignorant stooges call them UAVs? I mean how does an aircraft flown by a pilot become unmanned when the word 'unmanned' is not used for aircraft? If it is a female pilot, would you say 'unwomanned'? Does it make sense?  The word is only used for manned and unmanned land vehicle, not for aircraft. But the unbelievable illiterates of today think 'unmanned' is applied to aircraft. Anything that flies without a pilot is said to be pilotless. And, an aircraft is not a vehicle, it's an aircraft, full stop. This is what today's society have been taught in schools run by drug addicted teachers unlike those of my days when they were strict in grammar and spelling. But today, who gives a f***?;Mick Carson;0;

Orchid, which allows for decentralized VPN services, uses POS to select which node on the network will route a user's internet hops. Of course, a larger stake makes them more likely to be selected for a certain block. However, if the stake is so large that they are being awarded more blocks than they can possibly handle (being asked to provide more bandwidth to the network than they are able), then the extra staked amount is wasted. This gives an incentive not to stake more than what is needed. And also, it's important to note that pools DO exist very explicitly on most POS networks, as they allow you to ""delegate"" your staked coin to someone who has met the minimum amount to stake (these minimums are usually in the range of thousands of USD). I think a better permanent solution would be to introduce an artificial dis-economies of scale into the network, by having the chance of being selected for a block vary sub-linearly to the amount of stake on the network. For example, Validator_Chance = (Stake)^(.99) or something like this.";michael antoun;0;

It might make sense for a private company to maintain some kind of database, but why would other groups care? 
My loosest thought is that any member of a sort of distributed system, like a supply chain would potentially want to participate due to the organizational/accountability benefits. But I'm not sure. Can anyone shed some light on this issue? Since maintaining a node is costly, why would I choose to accept that cost?

UgwanpIfhiaF3eTcekZ4AaABAg;2020-05-27T14:18:39Z;Hi Simply Explained, in terms of security, I have a question that would love to hear from you, In this instance, lets compare two hardware wallets, I heard the Cobo Vault Pro private keys are derived from physically generated entropy (TRNG) which is the randomness is only determined by human decision and TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers (like atmospheric noise) however if compared with the Ellipal Titan, the Ellipal is only using PRNGs which uses mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated) which in lay man terms means another computer can actually predict the private keys with the use of computers? Also is the private keys the only factor which is affected by the TRNG or PRNG and are passphrase creation affected by TRNG or PRNG? And last question, when a hardware wallet says you can import your own private keys, does it mean you can create and invent your own private keys and if yes, how do we actually create our own private keys and is a private key used for the entire wallet or per type of coin wallet? Thanks Simply Explained!!!;Humpty Dumpty;0;

""Breakpoint set but not yet bound"". 
This was because my .map file wasn't created even though I had set sourceMap: true in my tsconfig.json. The solution for me was to remove my tsconfig file and generate a new one from the tsc command line.
tsc --init
That generated me a new tsconfig.json and I was able to uncomment the lines
 ""inlineSourceMap"": true,               /* Emit a single file with source maps instead of having a separate file. */
    ""inlineSources"": true,                 /* Emit the source alongside the sourcemaps within a single file; requires '--inlineSourceMap' or '--sourceMap' to be set. */

UgxHK_KusXP7uytQhSt4AaABAg;2020-06-07T02:04:16Z;"This approach of using 3 computers as ""brain"" is derived from/based on the main computer of Soviet Space Station ""Mir"" from the early 80th, it was called ""3—Ö-–∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª–∫–∞"", i.e. ""3-channeled"". The idea is the same -- 3 computers in parallel run the same program and react to the same inbound data and commands. Each tick, special hardware compares states of 3 computers -- if 2 computers have the same state, but 3rd got different one -- the ""correct state"" will be selected based on majority approach.  And the 3rd machine will be either refreshed( in many cases it was simply clonning the state of CPUs and memory from ""correct"" machine), either rebooted. If 3 sequential refreshes can't fix it during some time, 3rd machine will be halted for some short period and then restarted once again. If restart can't help -- it will immediately get in touch with cosmonauts and send signal back to  Earch mission control center.  One of the most complicated parts is actually the one that compares 3 computers and does ""voting"". It has to guarantee it got snapshots of machines in sync, and it has to withstand any radiation, temperature and vibration. Also, they had system that is activated if all 3 machines got complitely different state. As far as I remember -- it was trying to rollback state of machines to the latest consistent and re-run program from that state/step. If this doesn't help -- ... there was secret protocol to be used. :)";krukhlis;0;

In fact, if it weren't for the graphical user interfaces on the Dragon 2, they could do everything with Arduinos. :)  This may seem funny, but I'm not kidding.  In comparison to the LVDC in the Saturn V's Instrument Unit, the Arduino Uno has a similar amount of memory for instructions (actually a bit more), a similar amount of RAM (actually a bit more), and over 1000 times the processing speed.  The Saturn V is a fairly complicated rocket, too, with 3 stages plus a reignition of the third stage for TLI.  The Falcon 9 is simpler, except for the first stage (which would need its own Arduinos) landing, but with 1000+ times the processing speed of the LVDC, I bet the Uno could handle that task.  SpaceX's use of modern-ish dual-core Intel CPUs is lavish, even extravagent (not counting GUIs) compared to what is needed.  Computationally, on the flight hardware itself, we went to the Moon and back on far less than what an Arduino Uno can do.;rbrtck;2;

Ugy9soy_cLJi8sd37Gd4AaABAg;2020-06-26T02:16:26Z;"First, this series is awesome! I'm here because I'm having API Gateway issues, but I did want to leave anyone that sees this video in the future with a slight code update. At the time of writing, callbacks aren't used in NodeJS 12.x, they now use returns. I *think* you can still use context, but honestly I'm still confused about what context does, and I haven't seen anyone use it. So instead we'll use async to handle the event and a return to bring it back to the caller. Here's the code:

------
'use strict';
console.log('Loading function');
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    let min = 0;
    let max = 10; 
    
    let generatedNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * max) + min;
    
    return(null, generatedNumber);
};

------

Everything else should be the same.";Better With Rum;2;
UgwLI25IYVRx1eWpPLh4AaABAg;2020-06-26T04:18:25Z;"i see they woud have 3 big problems here (among many others).
1 - how you would decentralize/randomize who would be ""judging"" who - if it's not computing power and rewards (already excellent news) how they will define it? random within what? all the users? geographic location?  
2 -  how you will decide what has to get downloaded live on the ""judging"" tangles and what will be on the cloud all the time. 
3 - how the algorythmn wouldn't be too heavy so that let's say, a mobile phone wouldn't be able to judge any transaction and how it wouldn't be too light so that it could be broken fast enough before new tips of the tangle come. 

my best guess is that they should use random cryptography. the cryptography that the next tangle would use to confirm the two of the former should depend on an equation which would be a mix of two of the former blocks randomized by itself in a way that the own cryptography could understand and is updated constantly. so it would be really hard to fake because 
1 old transactions would be old within seconds and really decentralized - so almost impossible to fake an old tangle
2 in order to fake a new tangle, you would need to get the right equivalency of both equations that would be on the next block, and in time.

anyway, i really believe this is by far the best idea out there. 
i really hope they have done well on those 2 and a half years.";Gustavo Albericchi Du Rocher;1;

Gold price can be very small, but I find it very hard to imagine such situation when it is absolutely worthless. Gold is a real object, it has some nice physical properties which makes it valuable in the industry. But even when there is no industry, you can at least use gold as a metal to make a tool, which makes it worth at least something.;Dmitry Chernikov;0;

It was supposed to be a distributed decentralized peer-to-peer cash system if you read the whitepaper, and for a time it was, but now its development is controlled by Blockstream, mining is controlled by Chinese cartels, it's only traded on centralized exchanges and because the network can't handle more than 7 transaction per second, the cost of making a transaction is now several dollars where it used to be cents. And because the block rewards halves every 4 years, miners won't be profitable unless they keep hiking transaction costs, so in 10 years users will have to pay $15 for a transaction to maintain the same level of security 
Bitcoin is no longer a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system as envisioned, it's something completely else, not what Satoshi envisioned 
And frankly, anyone would be kind of stupid to think the very first iteration of a blockchain was going to be the most successful one and so well made that it could never be improved upon. Bitcoin was awesome, it changed the world and paved the way for a lot of cool things, but it was a beta version of a blockchain, it can not support a global economy or billions of users and Blockstream and their die hard followers has made it clear Bitcoin won't be improved because ""code is law"" (except of course for the one time where an exploit allowed 1 dude to mint as many Bitcoin he wanted, but we're not supposed to talk about that)
So anyway, there are 1000s of shitcoins and scams out there without a doubt, but there are also some really exciting successful projects that actually see use beyond pure speculation and cultist fanboyism";Scrooge McDuck;3;

It's a very nice instructional video you have made, and it takes place quietly, so everyone can follow - nicely made! I have a sketch that shows the time (clock), with an update every minute. It appears on the E-Paper display and it is ESP32 board that controls it. It is powered by a battery. I want to hear if you could make a small modification, so that it is not updated 24 hours a day, but only at certain time of the day, to save battery. It could e.g. Go in Deep sleep at 2300 and then wake up again at 0700, thereby saving power on the night, when I am not looking at the clock. Is it possible?
Yours sincerely

I don't get your point about surveillance. Starlink is just another way to access the internet. Do you worry about surveillance of your ISP? What about your government?

With the surveillance I'm referring to Starlink being a project actively supported by the US government, which should raise concerns as we know how they love to track everything we do through the internet. And well yes ISPs collect data on our online activities too, everything has to go through them.

I am in the process of building this for my home, but have come up with a problem.
After 60 samples of values are shown on the Arduino IDE monitor window the readings drop to zero.
I have changed the 1 second sampling to 3 seconds, and still after 60 samples, it goes to zero!
I am running all new resistors and capacitors, confirmed all ok, the CT clamp is same model, and i have confirmed i am getting Vac from it.
I have tried different input pins on the ESP32, tries calibration values, tried changing the 1480 averaging value, but still no more than 60 readings!

UgzKW_zwgvqs4Fvdv8J4AaABAg;2020-08-28T21:21:30Z;Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that hash doesn't have to me a unique identifier. Collisions can occur (two sets of data can have the same hash). Chances for it to happen by chance are extremely thin. Pretty much the only way for it to happen is to basically do a lots of calculations. SHA-1 used e.g. in Git got recently broken - some researches have found a pretty reliable way to do, albeit itrequires a huge amount of computing power;Strange;0;

Ugyt7n_okND51h7q9Gh4AaABAg.97mdb5qrn6-9DMXc5IPzol;2020-09-08T21:43:03Z;I would add simpler explanation. We have forgotten to take into account the biggest lurking variable - population growth (generational). The number of households consuming may have increased and cause an uptick in the electricity consumption of those appliances, even if the price or other variables were held constant. Your reply is spot. However, we could add the fact that the growth rate of households would in any case increase electricity consumption even with those marginal reductions. Finally, have you ever heard of planned obsolescence? It is the deliberate process of giving technology short lifespans. Thus, with the utility diminishing faster, there would be a greater replenishment of those appliances which contributes a greater usage in electricity despite the energy efficiency of appliances.  In general, we need to look at lurking variables such as population and perceptive response. Perceptive being the tendency of people to act in ways that contradict our intuition of their actions e.g. a rumor about a bank run tends to cause the bank run, even if the bank hadn't initially had solvency issues and this becomes a feedback loop.;ant0n _xp;0;

Ugz99GhpzufWgoEKIQV4AaABAg;2020-09-17T04:20:36Z;"Hy I have a question.
Is it better for a miner to drive with normal diff or is a higher diff better?
I understood that it depends on more ( coin, time, global diff, global hashrate, poolhashrate, my hashrate and more )
What I have not understood is how I find my best diff.
For example : 
Currently mine me with a scrypt Asic about 400Mh/s
Wiki says the best diff is 32678
If I do this for an hour I get one or two small wins, but I set the miner to 8192
I get 20 - 25 finds in one hour with a very small reward Al's before but much more often and all in all it makes a difference.
But then again miningrigrentals and some others say that the diff should be at least 10x higher but then I don't find anything.
I would be very grateful for any useful information about this.
Lg and happy Mining";Pierre Fikota;1;

You (a ""node"") have a file of transactions on your computer (a ""ledger""). Two government accountants (let's call them ""miners"") have the same file on theirs (so it‚Äôs ""distributed""). When you make any transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.

Each accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it (and be paid their salary ""Bitcoins""). The first to check and validate hits ‚ÄúREPLY ALL‚Äù, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction (""proof of work""). If the other accountant agrees, everyone updates their file‚Ä¶

That includes the stock market, real estate, & everywhere else.

Except in Proof of Work the miners benefit from it more than investors or  those who ""hodl"".
You can't even build apps or cloud storage/databases on a PoW blockchain because it's too difficult, time consuming & slow. 
Bitcoin is limited to its monetary capabilities. Its a great store of value but that's all it will ever be.  By all means HODL some BTC. 
But you can easily HODL a stablecoin & earn consistent returns through interest on DeFi apps without price volatility.

Proof of Stake, though, is more decentralized by far, works as a store of value & can have more than 1 purpose. You can build apps & databases on top of a PoS blockchain because it's fast & comprises high scalabilty. It is able to provide solutions to real world problems. There's an abundance of utility although not everything is worth having on chain nor should it be. A lot of useless coins/tokens out there; shitcoins.


Ultimately, Bitcoin's tendency to deplete the Earth's finite resources, waste time, energy & computing power is what makes it a legacy system.";Falling Shadow;0;

UgwLCJva8EXMftODKQF4AaABAg;2020-10-26T15:47:05Z;I didn't understand the notary example. A notary verifies the identity of a person and certifies that it was that person that signed the document on the date of the notary's signature. How will blockchain verify identities? That's no improvement over the way it is done now. I didn't understand the voting either. What's to keep an illegal alien from stealing someone's ballot and casting a ballot for some candidate that promises to give him free stuff? I didn't understand the food example either. Does anyone really think I am going to give out my name, address, phone number, and email every time I buy a friggin apple? Not happening. I didn't understand the package tracking either. I already do this via the USPS, FedEx, UPS, etc. Who needs some new system that isn't any better than what we already have? I didn't understand the smart contracts either. Doctors can already access my information since the communists in Congress have forced Obozo care down our throats and made medical insurance unaffordable for almost everyone. This blockchain idea is nothing but a scheme to steal our individual liberties an impose more government control over our lives. No thanks.

The person that paid a car worth of taxes, and would have bought a car with those funds, is literally missing a car that he should have had. The government didn't ""increase spending"", just funned funds, like the parasite that it is.

In Fiat currency, you at least know who is charging you or looting from you, but for digital currencies the owners are hiding. They take our identity, but who knows the wallet owners identity? Need some regulations so that it can grow. Traffic rules are good for cars....

That means when she sent the data to Bob, he has the matching key aka private key to unlock it. So if you already have Bob's public key, his private key can be hacked/reveal using brute force making the computer guess until it finds the correct private key. No problemo.;Flash Tech;0;

UgxxJZKiCNt_Hz-Gksd4AaABAg;2020-11-09T18:24:14Z;This is very similar to the route I went down around 2007 for my energy monitoring, ecept I used a much larger CT which wasn't split and I had to do the ballasting for the CT myself and mesure AC voltage. THey weren't as easily obtainable back then.  It worked OK ish with high resistivite loads but it was pitiful at low typical loads with a high reactive element.  I abandoned the CT route and moved to a blink timing and counting from the main meter using  a photo transistor.  Thats still the system I use in 2020.  Very accurate.  The only downside is that at low power consumtion the pulses can be a long time apart and so don't update too frequently.  The meter is a typical 1000 pulse per kWh so at 60 watts the pulses are a minute apart. . at 3.6 kW a second apart. THere is a further problem usng the ESP32 in that the analog to digital converter is a bit iffy (read non linear) at the ends of the voltage scale,;Stephen Taylforth;0;

First, they receive your password in plaintext which you enter into whatever login screen. Then, they hash it, and then use bcrypt on it. They will then retrieve the stored password hash from their databases, and decrypt it. At this point, the password you sent to them has been hashed, and bcrypted, and the password they stored has been decrypted, so if they are the same password, it should be equal. If they are equal, then that means you entered the correct password.";Alejandro D.;1;

The why he is doing it is something that many of us get behind.

It's just the value of the last transaction times all the assets. If any whale tried dumping their coin, market cap would fall immediately and the value they'd get would be nothing even close to their share of the previous market cap. And more importantly vice versa, whales can buy massive amounts of coins underpriced, through suppressing the price and small bot transactions.

Why? Why do I need to ""Use PlatformIO's dependency manager to automatically install and update any Arduino library you want to use.""

Makes the I in ""Integrated Development Environment"" look incorrect and silly.

And why am I going to be typing in the name of a library, with all the potential that for error that introduces? Can't I just click it, like the Arduino IDE?  My memory is not what it was, I can't remember things the way I used to when I was 20.

The biggest change is that Arduino GPIO pin identifiers have a D in them and ESP32 doesn't.  Once you choose the right board in the Arduino IDE, the linker chooses the right version of the library (with occasional warnings ""duplicate library found"" but it always chooses the right one for me.) 
I just gave my ESP32 binary clock to its recipient, who is very happy with 3 different displays, Wifi time setting, time zone changing, auto dimming, network selection and password entry.  Next is a ""spaceship control panel"" for a granddaughter, I'm just programming the radar, and maybe that can switch to be a quick driving game in the same display, she can switch between them and the countdown with NASA voice and the takeoff sequencing...

I'm not a professional programmer and I've never got PlatformIO to actually work; or, at least, not to the extent of compiling and running anything more complex than ""hello World"" and today it wouldn't even do that.

You can program your code/script in a way that it can extract all of your music to some file. You don't need to create a program from scratch to obtain the data from your playlist. Say that Spotify does offer an API that allows fetching data from a playlist. You can extract the data with an API key by embedding the API key to the URL provided by spotify. Once you are able to extract the obtain the URL, some other program (fron the API) will generate a JSON file for you. In other words, API works in favor of you especially for data scraping and data mining.;Health Inspector;1;

Ugwo0TZF8rCRTgNNpnl4AaABAg;2020-12-01T18:38:23Z;"Whoop-de-do. Revolutionary, huh?

This is something that is intended to impress the uninitiated.

Well, I was a programmer for many years so ... here come some references.

The hierarchical model database was introduced in the 60s by IBM. It was called IMS. Each record pointed to the next record.

Linked lists were developed 10 years earlier, in the 50s. Linked lists and binary trees were used to develop those hierarchical structures.

And now, we have blockchain, something brand new, something mysterious, something revolutionary, something everyone is gushing about. In reality, it's nothing more than another implementation of a linked list, one that connects blocks of data by hashes instead of pointers. Oh, wait, I forgot. It's distributed. I guess that's what makes it brand new and revolutionary.

This is a better mousetrap. The reason why it exists today and not 50 years ago is because then we could not pass data fast enough between the nodes. Even today, if you notice, blockchain technology is not really being developed that quickly. They've been talking about it and talking about it. They've been talking a lot and not doing much. Do you know why? 10 minute proof of work is a real killer? Stock exchanges process data in milliseconds. 10 minutes? Seriously? Also, even with today's fiberoptic networks, it takes a long time to share the massive ledger with every member of the network.

It's a good technology but it has limitations and because of those limitations, it will not be adopted in many business areas. Same as desalination technology is not going to be adopted around the world because it creates a poisonous byproduct. Same as electric cars will not just explode and replace gasoline cars all over the world. In another 5-6 years, people will be faced with the difficult task of disposing of used-up batteries and shortages of rare earth metals.";Jake O;0;

UgwiF-hzxYR1EKN_Q2x4AaABAg;2020-12-14T13:17:09Z;"My problem with getting blockchain usage though my head, is that all the uses do not require blockchain to be made. 

For example, why do we have to use blockchain when listening to songs in order to have the authors paid? Why not use ""conventional"" methods, like, write all the songs someone wrote on a database, and at the end of the month, distribute them accordingly. 

Why not have your car statistics sent to your insurance with each trip? Why use blockchain and hashes.

Apart from specific use cases, where you have to create a ""tamper"" proof method for something, I don't understand why we should use blockchain.

It's not like having your car mileage sent to your insurance company already exists (maybe it does). But, I think, let's create this IoT feature (sending the mileage), then you can get your insurance to adjust your contract according to your stats, and then, IF we have suspicions and testimonials of tampering, we could consider blockchain.

It's like having an RF-id / card to open a door to your house. In my mind, all these examples say ""with the technology of RF-id, we can now have houses"". Ummm, no, we can have some improvements that might solve some potential problems, but most things mentioned in this video can be created without blockchain.

Can someone explain this to me, cause I'm going insane thinking I might be stupid and missing out on a key point that will make this have much more sense.";Geniustrash;0;

And they are under a dollar, even at single digit volumes, actualy the listing is gone :(  Now even from mouser at high volumes it's still a bit over a dollar for 28 pin dips,  but lower pin models are still under a dollar at single digit volumes so my point still stands.  Several bucks for a large bulky arduino, or 40¬¢ for a small dip or surface mount controller?  If you don't need the power and flexability of an arduino, it's a no brainer why they aren't the most cost efficient option for anything but low volume productions.;John Smith;0;

UgxaPywwc0XBi1HB_Z54AaABAg;2020-12-22T14:43:23Z;I don't get why this is a problem, on a decentralized public blockchain, you own your data through your private key, this means that it is controlled by yourself! Not by a company or other third party. Therefore, a decentralized public blockchain complies with GDPR by definition. However, many people don't own their private keys, because they use an exchange, which is a third party that controls your data. Exchanges hold your personal information on their centrally controlled servers, not on blockchain, therefore exchanges are data controllers that need to comply to GDPR. Decentralized public blockchains already comply by definition.;Mr. Bas;0;

I'm new to block chain, but this recalls on my memory the Ariadne authentication protocol that kept the whole chain of block hashes each time(some how similar to this)
Although this seems the most informative way (everything is stored) a possible attack was to switch two  previous blocks, or similar actions where the rest will remain the same?
Then a possible solution was to store the cascaded of all previous hashes to hide the plain hash of each block, and keep the relative order info hashed too.

UgwUzlyINe8B1GZAVkB4AaABAg;2020-12-26T16:04:02Z;"This is what happens when somebody makes a video before they know what they're talking about. Unfortunately these days that seems to be about 99% of the time. You are conflating serverless with cloud computing and mixing up the benefits and the descriptions as if they were all one thing.

It's always easy to tell when someone doesn't actually know the definition of the thing they are trying to tell you about. THEY NEVER ACTUALLY DEFINE THE THING. All they ever do is talk about the features and the benefits without ever telling you what the thing is or how the thing actually works.

With cloud computing you still have to be concerned about a server. That server may not be your own physical hardware. And that server might be virtualized or inside of a container. Your cloud service provider will spin up multiple containers if you need them. But you still have to have configured those containers that are virtualized servers...

With serverless computing you can forget about even worrying about those containers. You never have to configure a server and you do not have to worry about how many of them are spun up or not. You do not design a little mini server to handle a little microservice and then put that in a container and then ask your cloud provider to spin up multiple copies of that as necessary. With serverless computing all you do is write a function. You give that function to the serverless service provider and let them worry about whether to put that on its own separate server or not. Rather than spinning up containers with their own abstracted away operating systems they simply allocate memory and CPU time to run that function and send you back the result. You never even had to think about a server or configure a server or containerize a server. That is the difference between cloud computing and serverless computing. Yes, all that is still on a server. But you never had to spend a moment of thought as to how that server was configured. You don't care, as long as your function returns the correct result.

What boggles my mind (AKA ""frustrates the hell out of me"")  is how much research I have had to do to figure out the difference because there are so many people like you who are in a hurry to jump in and say something, ANYTHING, so they can get the likes and views before anyone else, that they get it completely wrong.";Grant Robertson;7;

You mentioned it as a counter-point of somehow being representative of the speed of the vaccine in which is completely false because there has never been a corona virus vaccine before, let alone for a super strain that managed to bring the entire world to it's knees. So the entire comment about the knowledge of corona virus is completely irrelevant to both safety and vaccines because said knowledge has done nothing to bring about a vaccine.

""Yes, 10 months is not a lot, if you compare it to traditional vaccines. However, the vaccines made by different companies have been tested with large groups and have seen very little side-effects ( headache, fatigue). This makes me confident that the vaccine will save many lives.""

Once again, immediate symptoms are merely one concern and if anything a vaccine that immediately shows adverse affects is MUCH safer than a vaccine that causes issues years down the line. If a vaccine gave adverse effects right away it would be pulled and worked on longer and not mass injected globally, however if problems are shown down the line after an unprecedented amount of people have had the vaccinations there is nothing you can do since people have already been injected with it.

""Perhaps. But I believe that my simplified explanation of mRNA vaccines is correct. But I respect your opinion.""
Your explanation of mRNA is fine, had no complaints there. However proclaiming ""safety"" in regards to an unprecedented 10 month vaccine, a vaccine in which is the first of it's kind, a vaccine that clearly has ""speed"" in mind due to the severity of the world right now, thus long-term ""safety"" is on the back-burner and you have this vaccine being distributed to every speck of the world and given to people who don't even have association with the virus yet. A global roll out such as this is also historically unprecedented and wasn't done for swine flu, bird flu, SARS, ebola and many more because those were minor viruses, yet here we are, first time doing a global roll out of a vaccine in a very long time and with a vaccine that was rushed and has completely unknown long-term effects.

""As for stepping away from the topic: let me choose how to use my time and the videos I make. If this video turns out to be competely misinformed, I will take it down. But I don't believe that to be the case right now.""

The mRNA part was fine. However long-term effects and thus ""safety"" of a vaccine not being known until much later on is not some subjective opinion, it's 100% fact. NO ONE can say ANY vaccine will not have some sort of long-term adverse effects precisely due to the complexity of our individual bodies and some people can have something dormant in them for decades only for it to interact with something adversely and lead to all manner of issues, this even applies to very minor drugs and something as simple as a treatment for a UTI can cause fatal insomnia if it happens to interact a certain way.

And of course instances of that are the anomaly, but guess what? When you have a vaccine that's the first of it's kind for ANY corona virus, a vaccine that has been made with unimaginable speed and has been globally distributed in a fashion that has never been done before THAT is the anomaly and NO ONE can know how this unknown vaccine will affect people in the future.

So in relation to you making content as an educator you need to have that type of understanding, of course it's a good thing it's out but the fact is NO ONE can tell you if it's safe or not, you need to let people know the complexity of the situation and not throw out naive ""oh it's safe!"" when in reality the creation, distribution and future repercussions of something like this is historically unheard of. You not only need a good understanding of biology but also a good understanding of the history of these type of things and also the current political, economic and geopolitical situation playing out right now and the psychology of the people who are trying to get this vaccines out.

Once again, the goal with this vaccine is speed, to get the world back to normal and avoid the absolutely crushing economical disaster that has come to pass. The idea of ""safety"" is a secondary objective, if it works it works, long term can be solved when it happens, that is their mindset and they are taking a VERY big risk with it. It's a hard call and your job as someone who puts themselves in a position to educate others should understand that complexity and explain this to people, not give some throwaway ""it's safe"" despite that being inherently false.";CneqCS;0;

UgxmJ_JLQqzyQo9qYt14AaABAg.9Ht2pr6mYWC9Ht8zk6F2ni;2020-12-30T09:07:35Z;"First of all, someone corrects me if I'm wrong.
1) the virus itself has its own DNA or RNA, it depends on the type of virus. hypothetically speaking, let's assume we have two types of human, a human that has DNA and another human that has RNA. both do the same thing in most cases. but I don't know the depth analogy about them.
2) all the cells inside your body have their own DNA. (Remember, we are human we have DNA in our cells.) the DNA is responsible for curing the cell itself and sending messages to other DNA cells. When a virus goes inside your body, it will find the most suitable cell to attack and own the cell easily. the virus sends a copy of instructions of their own gene to the cell and forces the cell to reproduce the same gene that the virus sent it to.  Regarding your question about your own body mDNA. it's not possible because you don't have mDNA :) you only have mRNA, tRNA, rRNA. the DNA only has one type in general. which is just DNA.(you can research more about DNA they are complicated.) Also, your body doesn't have one single DNA, and the virus controls that. it's not like that. your cells get affected when you get sick not the genes or chromosomes when a virus or bacteria entered your body.
3) your immune system will attack ANYTHING except your own MUSCLES AND CELLS AND ORGANS. other than those it will attack everything. A vaccine has the real virus itself. but the genes are modified and the virus got weaker. the virus can not invade any of your cells because it does not have any power because of the modified genes. Well, you might ask what is the point of that? The human immune system has a memory dedicated to all the attacks that have been done on foreign items that go inside your body. your immune system is responsible to kill any foreign bacteria/virus that enters your body. when they kill the virus/bacteria successfully. all the instruction that how they killed the bacteria/virus goes to your memory immune system which is called B-cells. who transfers those data? T-cells(research if you want to know more about them). that way, if the weaker virus goes to your body and doesn't have any power to dominate your cells, after that, the virus gets killed easily and your memory cell got the instruction to kill the virus next time if it enters your body. that's the main point of vaccination.";AlanD20;0;

UgwRQLQB5NcjO9V9q114AaABAg;2021-01-10T04:28:23Z;I think I have a pretty good idea of how a block is added on the Bitcoin blockchain, but I find the above reference to proof of work confusing relative to my understanding.  Why is it referred to as a consensus algorithm?  What does that even mean?  My concept of Proof of work is that it is just a competition between miners designed to try as many random numbers as they can, plugging them and all the transactions that they pulled from the web that they wish to add into a block on the chain, mash it all up, and get a number that is less in value than the hashed result of the previous block.  When they win the race, they earn bitcoin and add the new ledger of transactions as a block on the chain of which the ledger also includes the bitcoin that they earned.  So, again, it is basically a race or a competition.  Where does this word consensus come from?  How does being the first to solve a problem of random transactions, pulled from the web, verify among the network of computers that the information added to the chain is valid?  How does racing to do a mathematical equation prevent double spending of bitcoin or of spending bitcoin that someone does not have?  No one has ever been able to clearly answer this question for me, so if you can, I sincerely thank you in advance.;Marc Rothman;0;

Ugzj0CyQgnYyzBFcNh14AaABAg;2021-01-11T20:51:42Z;This is the beautiful side of the story. What is not know for now is whether the mRNA in the vaccine can be changed (reverse transcribed) into DNA and be integrated in the genome. This has been observed with C19 RNA (MIT study), which is one of the reasons for long-term covid. But, even if the vaccine RNA is integrated in chromosomes, it may have no effect. Another issue I noted with the mRNA vaccines is the use of saline as placebo. It would have been much better to compare to scrambled RNA lipid nanoparticles to assess adverse events of this new technology...;Bob Do;0;

1) i think part 1 is protein (eg protein spike ) related..the whole protein folding thing i am ok with......but i still struggle to get how a shred of genetic material has the ablility/luck to find an appropriate host cell, and physically transform that cell into its slave, so to speak... i see the possibility of a chemical reaction on the contact/surface of the intruder /healthy cell join...but how/why the effects after that...??  ps...what are the most common ""receptor""s found on normal healthy cells and what are they used for in normal life...?? 
2) Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA or mDNA) is  located in mitochondria, which is in most of our cells...even wikipedia says so...!!
3) question still stands...if the body produces the original B & T cells etc why does the body then attack those resulting cells...?..since they are not foreign any more but local produce....also there must be other good cells floating aroung that use the same spikes\folds etc for normal healthy usage....?  or they wouldnt exist in the first place...?

further thoughts...
1) has this or any virus ever been properly isolated...?
2) why did the Bavarian State Gov budget 20 billion euros for covid 19  measures...in may 2019...six months before the outbreak...?
3)  what happened to the ""vaping disease"" reported by the CDC in July 2019...in Maryland...near Fort Detrick... scene of the outbreak for 1918 spanish flu.....and why dont we talk about the 2019 military games...held in Wuhan...early December 2019...just weeks before the ""outbreak""...??

They've taken the code from the virus spikes outside the cell, so your DNA is not involved. Normally your DNA does create it's own mRNA in the Nucleus, that then goes into the main part of the cell (Cytoplasm). The mRNA is like a car delivering the pizza. In this case Domino's is delivering to you. The point is to have those spiked proteins reproduced by your own cells, sent on their way and then your body builds a defense (antibodies) against them. Since it's only the outside spikes of the C-virus, you don't get sick, but your body now has a way to fight the real Covid virus if you get infected.;Slomak;0;

In Norway 13 people have died in nursing homes now shortly after taking the vaccines.
If someone tried to force me to take this I'd literally fight for my life. I have a bachelors degree in biotechnology and I would never consider taking such a vaccine, they can put anything they want into that code. You avoided telling us how this mRNA enters the cell too.

There won't be long term effects from mRNA, as rna is very fragile and expelled from the body quickly.

Because the spike is a protein found on the outside of the virus. They isolated the RNA sequence responsible for making the spike in the virus, took it out and put just that in the vaccine, which will tell your cells to make just that part, the spike.

""to me sounds like having some fruits but without having the tree that produces it. "" Kinda? For this analogy, imagine they took the instructions from an apple seed that made the apple, but not the rest of the tree, and put that in the ground. All that would grow would be an apple.

there are studies about the implications of damaged mRNA and how the cells respond to them. mRNA is very unstable and that's why they need to be contained in nanolipids and stored at low temps.

How many % of the mRNA remain perfect after transportation and storage? What sort of proteins do our cells produce when decoding damaged mRNA? Could toxic proteins be produced and cause immediate reactions or long term issues such as cancer? how would the body cope with unintended proteins produced as a result of damaged mRNA?

IMO, there are many unanswered questions, and much research still to be done before we can tick this off as safe.";Eddy G;2;

UgxeSNWmHiimePKI4_N4AaABAg;2021-01-22T00:06:37Z;In other words, you are saying that a healthy human cell is used as an incubator for the COVID 19 spikes inside a heathy human body? This is highly risky and dangerous and many things could go terribly wrong. To begin with, cells replicate themselves. So there is a chance that the cell with the COVID 19 spikes starts replicating itself becoming like a cancer cell. If the COVID 19 Spikes are produced in large quantities before the anti bodies are created, there is a chance that so many cells would be infected by the spikes, that the immune system would be overwhelmed. Besides, one should understand that the body's immune system would never attack the body's own cells, even if they are infected with a cancer virus or spikes of CIVID 19.Therefore, these mRNA drugs similar to the DNA drugs are a ticking time bomb inside our body ready to explode at any moment! A safer way would be to use an animal cell to use as an incubator for COVID 19 spikes, or like the NOVA VAC company did, moth larvae. Once the spikes are produced in large quantities, they are then packaged in the usual serum format to be injected, with the human immune system doing its job naturally, without sacrificing any healthy cells and risking COVID 19 Spike infected cells from becoming a cancer.;Diomede Cassar;0;

In case anyone else had the same problem I did I offer this sad tale of woe. Inspired by this video I immediately installed Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO on my Windows system. It took a little work to make the PlatformIO icon appear, but that's OK, its free software so no complaints. Unfortunately it was impossible to load the Espressif platform as a PlatformIO error popped up: ""PIO Core Call Error: 'DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.' ""  3 minutes of video turned into 3 hours of real time software installation frustration.

After the usual timewasting Google search and various board and forum wanderings it turns out this is a known error which the maintainer has no intention of fixing. If you have multiple *unofficial* Python installations, particularly Anaconda, this confuses PlatformIO and it chokes,

Sorry Ivan the Terrible, I love my Anaconda and mongrel Python packages more than I need PlatformIO. Too bad, it looks cool. I can probably set up a clean virtual environment at some point and that should work, but right now I'm going to take a nap.";grepthis2000;1;

Except... in the evening, this is painful to watch, unfortunately.
Extra blue light (which, as you should know, you have a lot in your white video) is a contraindication for people with many circadian and sleep disorders. For example, I have chronic insomnia. In my case, it is possible to deal with it. And one of the rules of dealing with it is not to watch such an image after dusk. Because I'm a developer, I have enough of a monitor and light already, so I have to restrict this even during the day.

This vaccines are basically give you an infection with genetically engineered adenovirus (usually in nature this virus is responsible for the common cold), that unable to replicate because of deletion of many important genes in it, they just use this virus to deliver genetic information to the cells of your body, so they can produce some sars-cov-2 spike proteins and trigger the immune system.

The truth is that our bodies were not designed to be ""tricked"" into doing such things. They are not designed to be exposed to annual ""Flu"" vaccines either. You can develop severe auto-immune diseases that are unexpected and unwelcome results. No scientist can possibly know all of the ramifications of this experiment. If they say that they do, they are lying. The potential to ""backfire"" is immediately apparent and is also now apparently proven. The best way is the natural way that our amazing bodies are designed with. I know a lot of people who have tested positive and have made it through with ""normal"" sickness symptoms to nearly no symptoms. Why would you in light of that knowledge (other than fear) choose the experimental approach that is already fitting the description ""the cure is worse than the disease""?

But this goes away. The deaths have not been linked to the vaccine. When you're vaccinating millions upon millions, many of these people 75+, you're going to see stories of people dying afterwards. However, it's likely they would have passed regardless from other various causes. The fact of the matter is vaccines are necessary for a healthy society and while the covid mRNA vaccine is the first to be used, it has been around for years and the technology is not new at all. It is shown that COVID itself can cause lasting, long term, debilitating effects if you are one of the unlucky ones.

Our body naturally makes these in our bone marrow, our b cells (white blood cells) travel in our blood. 
B cells are the cells that produce/manufacture antibodies! When we have had an infection, B cells will produce antibodies to fight that infection (along with triggering of other immune responses like getting a fever when you're sick). Antibodies will then stick around in your body for a little bit before naturally decreasing in quantity, however memory B cells (white blood cells that 'remember' the infection you got) will stay for longer and if they run across that virus or bacteria again they will make more antibodies to fight it.

Regarding Covid specifically a couple studies were done that show people who got COVID had antibody levels decrease after about 20 days post infection, while memory B cells that remember the COVID virus stuck around for 8 months after infection. Vaccines are generally more effective that natural immune response without us needing to get sick in the first place, this is also great because if we get immunity while not being sick, we can't pass the virus on and the spread of COVID will decrease, so you'll be even less likely to get it in the first place!

(2)  The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has only been tested on 30,000 people (79% of them were white) (NIH website states this).  (3)  The vaccine only underwent clinical trials for 4 months (the NIH website states this), therefore no long-term studies have ever been done on humans for mRNA vaccines, let alone this vaccine in particular.  What long term effects could there be?  No one knows.  This technology is literally causing your body to have an immune response to the proteins it's own self is producing - what could go wrong?  What if some of the mRNA hangs around and doesn't get properly destroyed by your body?  What if your cells are hypersensitive to the protein or become hypersensitive, such that any exposure to the virus causes a WORSE reaction than would have been had you never had the vaccine? 

Literally no one has the answers to these questions.  And they want to give us a vaccine - some 7+ billion people, when it's only been tested on 30,000 people, 79% of which were white?  This is laughably ridiculous and unscientific, but if you follow the money, you'd see why.";Chris Snyder;9;

They do not know how long the 2 shots last.  Could be 2 months for some people, 8 months for others.  Guessing game as to when they are going to give you a booster.  Check out the CDC VAERS report for the thousands of adverse effects happening to the public that the Main Scream Media is not telling you.  That is supposedly only 1% reporting  but even if it is 25% reporting it is extremely worrisome.  People who question Big Pharma are called anti vaxxers.

""You know that nothing will happen in a few years because of what data?"" Because everything from the vaccine is out of your system in maybe a couple of months. Nothing there to cause issues after a year.

""Have you even looked at the CDCs own website of the VAERS report"" First off, the CDC and VAERS are completely different organizations; one has nothing to do with the other. Secondly, literally anyone at any time can make a VAERS report without any evidence whatsoever.  VAERS is not an indication that a vaccine is dangerous; hell, a layperson such as yourself shouldn't even look at it, because you aren't trained to interpret the reports and weed out the bullshit.

And when such vaccines start attacking what our DNA produce naturally, it will more likely lead to auto-immune disease.
And even worse when human-DNA is GMO‚Äôd, we humans, become property of BigPharma and it can be easy to be controlled remotely.

These m-RNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer also include sterilizing agents and subsets of HIV as recently, it showed some of the people who took them, also got infected with HIV.

Pfizer have been sued for billions for fraud over the years, and now we should trust them to rush a vaccine that will go straight into the cells of the whole population on earth? Hell no!
Is it REALLY that easy to develop mRNA, in a month, as they say? It seems very rushed, no matter how much money you throw at it.

Also, I'm curious, and maybe somebody know...In this video, the idea is that there is just one specific ligand coded in the mRNA. Is it actually a bigger chunk of the exterior virus coat? Would more ligands increase specificity, or confuse the immune system more? hmmmm?";Alona Harris;1;

UgwhS07bqPcAfLsz6QV4AaABAg;2021-01-29T04:59:00Z;Not so easy as it seems. At first for me as a medic. There are some questions: 1) how long will this mRNA translate itself on ribosomes, 2) what happened with synthesised S protein - goes it out of cell or located on the surface of the cell?, 3) in case of location on the surface of cell which synthesized S protein can this cell itself become the target for immune system and initiate autoimmune reactions?, 4) are the cells which synthesize S protein specified or it could be any cell?, 5) as it's known S protein similar to ACE2 protein - so will the antibodies synthesized against S protein block also this normal protein and prevent its normal function in human organism? Thank you for answers in advance!;Drak Drakov;1;

This type of vaccines has never been used before on humans and many animals when this  technology was used died. The protein spike coding can be inaccurate and create irreversible for human body damage invading the human cell and transmitting the information about this spike. What about auto immune respond? Why you don't mention the serious details regarding to mrna technology? People have a perfect intellectual capacity to learn the details of the process and have the rights to be aware of consequences if the technology goes wrong.

UgwzQ0O_HTcWP1AfGx54AaABAg;2021-01-29T14:54:52Z;"My question is similar to Drak Drakov's:
Does the spike protein manifest as a structure on the human cell, and if so, is there a risk of autoimmune reactions where antibodies attack the human cells which have this protein structure? Or, does the protein structure ""break off"" of the cell surface, circulate, and by that means cause an immune response that does not involve the cells themselves?";kayakutah;2;
UgwhS07bqPcAfLsz6QV4AaABAg.9J4xOEVYnXV9J61V4YCjpv;2021-01-29T15:02:52Z;"Good questions, Drak. As to #5, I believe the spike protein is the ""mirror image"" of the ACE-2 protein on the cell surface, so an antibody that can attach to the spike wouldn't attach to the ACE-2. But I do have a concern if the spike manifests on the cell membrane as in your question #3. That seems like it would result in antibodies attaching to healthy cells.
As to question #1, half lives of naturally occurring mRNA molecules seem to be measured in minutes to hours. I don't know what it is for this vaccine, but it's an excellent question! I would guess that it's not on the order of days, though, once the lipid coating is shed.";kayakutah;0;

UgybkQKlnVwFn2f00IN4AaABAg.9J6wSi9qSl69J9T6EzvBLY;2021-01-30T23:01:51Z;"@Tony Roy, thanks.  In short, basically yes.  However, if you‚Äôre one of the *rare few* who have a history of anaphylaxis or you have to carry an epipen, then probably best not to get the vaccine.  Otherwise, yes, *please do* get the vaccine;  you‚Äôre very unlikely to see worse side effects than soreness at the injection site, and maybe slight fatigue.

Even those who do have a history of anaphylactic shock are statistically on the order of 1 in 11 million (see reference below) to react to the vaccine.  Definitely check with your doctor, and get vaccinated at a facility that can treat you in the unlikely event you do get a reaction.

I gather that there‚Äôs been some uncertainty with regard to pregnancy.  Although the vaccine trials excluded pregnant women from the start, some trial participants became pregnant during the course of the trial, and neither the fetus/child nor the mother suffered any ill effects.  So I gather that most doctors see no reason not to get the vaccine if you‚Äôre pregnant.  Probably not a bad idea to ask your doctor first though.  https://youtu.be/KVLndvFlvEI";Gary Morrison;0;

While being decentralized and difficult to enforce any censorship it seems to have the usual security risks as peers can be tracked and identified on the ‚Äònetwork‚Äô no matter how large and widespread it is. Unstoppable Domains is also an interesting candidate (in the decentralized category) but this one is not free and can only be accessed with special plug-ins and resembles TOR in many ways (hard to access and needing proprietary software components). The best solution may be peer-to-peer infinite modules (for the content creation side) gathered on the fly impossible to trace or stop and some  blockchain cloud server (for storage of data) that would be free to use with no IP tracing.

The thing is that proof of stake is an authoritative model, which defeats the whole fucking point.
Proof of work works because it would cost more to ‚Äúfake‚Äù a valid block than it is to mine one. 
That is constant. It will always be harder to fake a block then to find a proof. 

However brilliant it is, the amount of computing power (not electricity, mind you) being wasted is immense. Which is why I invite everyone to find solutions for that.
I‚Äôve been working on it for a while but it‚Äôs a genuinely immense problem to solve, every solution fails in a way or another. 
For a solution to be valid it needs to maintain the current model. ie: the existing hardware shouldn‚Äôt go to waste, the miner income shouldn‚Äôt be reduced. 
But also deliver on factors beyond the model: utilisation of the hardware (there is nothing keeping us to replacing what today is ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù which is synthetic with real equations we want to solve). 
The amount of transactions in a block, in my opinion, should be fluid but the amount of work fixed. 
This computing power shouldn‚Äôt be wasted. Replacing bitcoin makes all that work go to waste. Reducing rewards greatly inflate economies of scale.
I‚Äôm also working on a non profit pool. The problem so far is that a fee is still needed for server cost and maintenance. That‚Äôs inacceptable, it should be part of the blockchain.";viraltaco;1;

If the money remains held in the smart contract until the ‚Äògoals‚Äô are met how do the lenders generate the money to meet the goals?

Since the product is synthetic with an mrna delivery system, my prediction is science won't be able to conquer a traditional medication therapy for your symptoms. 

In two or three years we will definitely be able to tell who received the vaccines.  Remember, they skipped the animal studies and went right into human trials!  No recourse, complete protection from future liability. This would never happen had not the Government declare a national emergency.  This is why the drug companies never got it approved, in 20 years, until now!!

All the responsibility for your defence is now depending on strong and viable clones of Tmemory-cells. Tm. That is the elegant function of vaccines. They initiate a response, that in fact initiates a next level response, as if there never had been any vaccine at all!
Your body is a state where it *would* have been, IF you had survived a fatal decease. Because of the vaccination, you never have to fight the decease, but your immunesystem cant make any distinctions between you as 'survivor'  or you as vaccinated.
You get the whole benefit from the vaccine alone.
The only reason for you to not be able to fight SARS-CoV2 would be that your *specific clone* of Tm 'grows old' and stop proliferating, those effects can be seen 6-8 y after a vaccination. 
In SARS-CoV2's example, that is however almost not possible, because there will be a subset of individuals, that denies to get the vaccine. Because of that, our immunesystem will constantly be 'reminded' about the antigen, and then Tm-clones do not 'fade out'.
...No ! The antivax nitwits are NOT doing 'us' a favour, the not-vaccinated population subset, is a severe risk of new variations of the virus, it is however not likely that the spike-protein will change, because that is in fact the virus' 'key' to the cells it need to attack.
In a more speculative direction we could however 'get' a new virus, that attacks other cell-types, but retain some of SARS-CoV2 characteristics: *Spe-cu-la-tions* 
wont happen

However, from what I've heard, preliminary studies seem to show that this vaccine will still work against all the current strains. It might work better against the older strains than the newer ones but it still provides some protection. 

But the beauty of mRNA vaccines is that if the spike does radically change it'll be pretty easy to alter the sequence of the mRNA to protect against the new protein without really changing anything else in the manufacturing process.";Bemused Bandersnatch;0;

Ugx7f5sZjUGAhHtuReN4AaABAg;2021-02-07T23:07:29Z;Ok, so just to bring about some caution- Bill Gates said in 2011 that he wants to reduce the population to 250 million and the best way is to do it by vaccines. Now 10 years later, do you think Bill Gates has changed? If he‚Äôs endorsing this Covid vaccine, do you think he‚Äôs doing it because he wants to save lives? I don‚Äôt think so. Just cause someone is injecting you with mRNA doesn‚Äôt make it safe because it‚Äôs a piece of genes being injected into you. you don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre injecting you with a piece of material that creates ‚Äúspikes‚Äù or creates a mutation that can make you have cancer, be infertile, or cause an autoimmune disease. Sure, if it‚Äôs just another ‚Äúvirus‚Äù they‚Äôre injecting you with, and you have a strong immune system, your body can fight it off. It‚Äôs concerning to me that they‚Äôre injecting older folks in nursing homes first. They‚Äôll be the first to die from this vaccine. They said they‚Äôre injecting the US military next and then the US healthcare workers third. Now they‚Äôre starting to inject the general population of Americans. Their goal is to get 100 million - or about 1/3 of Americans vaccinated. What‚Äôs also interesting is that they‚Äôre not even working on a vaccine for children any time soon. So I guess their goal is to kill off all the weak, old and feeble people that can‚Äôt fight off disease and leave the children alone? The World Health Organization leaders are very fond of China- which ironically fabricated this virus in their lab in Wuhan. Don‚Äôt believe me? When it opened, it said it was one of the labs with the most dangerous pathogens studied and worked on. Somehow SARS ‚Äúescaped‚Äù from that lab several years ago. But hey, I guess we have to get ready for a one world government soon with a one world currency, and China will be over the US and the US will be Communist controlled very soon.;Hannah Higgins;0;1

There is just no way your average Joe can invest enough to see a good monthly return,  you are literally crossing your fingers and praying to god that your coins go up in value like crazy,  when PoW pays your average miner a decent amount daily that they can actually turn a profit without having to constantly dump their money into a wallet to earn cents.";Esteban Garita;0;

UgyZJ4YPaVFBHyvuJ0t4AaABAg;2021-02-14T04:51:32Z;"I have been writing a small one in Go, trying to figure out the garbage collection problem of the way that we currently define blockchains.  I am using an account-balance-with-nonce model for the simple coin; kind of like Ethereum (very simple to stop double-spending, easy to explain).  

I immediately ran into the problem of trying to ensure that all amount flows sum to zero.  There has to be somebody in the system with negative balances; and that would be the mints.  That is either where something needs to be backed by an asset like Gold, or where you have to use Proof-of-work or something else to justify minting money.

The garbage-collection problem is hard.  The current systems hash the transactions that make up the database state.  It's possible to incrementally hash the database state; so that you can present a trash-compacted version of history that comes out to the same database.  This might work, because the whole point in this is just to force everyone to agree on a consistent database; when there is an incentive to fork into versions where people have their goods, but can un-spend their money.  I'm not so sure that going back all the way to Genesis is going to work in the long run; because it implies storing an infinite number of transactions.  

So I am experimenting with using elliptic curves to incrementally hash a database state; in case the existing systems don't give you a horizon at which further validation into the past isn't justified.  (ie: don't iterate from Genesis forward.... Start from the block and database state that you have, and work transactions backwards until you find an inconsistency between current state versus previous state plus transaction.  There has to be a horizon at some point, where the Genesis block can be considered moved up.

With Bitcoin and unspent transactions output, I am not sure if you can move the Genesis horizon up to take out the trash.  You care about balances being perfect, and double-spending being impossible.  It's more a bug (ie: liability) than a feature that all the transactions must be hauled around by the whole world; forever.";Rob Fielding;0;
UgyZJ4YPaVFBHyvuJ0t4AaABAg.9Jj8F_EtylW9Jj8y3kXWjy;2021-02-14T04:57:45Z;"One of the big garbage collection issues is.... how to deal with trash from people losing their keys.  With a way to lease out a presence in the chain, and some kind of inheritence rule for lost funds; you could sustainably run a blockchain forever, within a fixed disk-usage size.  That's because there would be a garbage-collection horizon, and a way to deal with people that tax the blockchain with garbage.";Rob Fielding;0;

Ugxkptv_MEz4spvSt6R4AaABAg;2021-02-21T15:52:57Z;"1.) New mRNA vaccines may change your DNA, permanently
According to Dr. Miklos Lukacs de Pereny, a research professor of science and technology in Peru, the COVID-19 pandemic was manufactured by the world‚Äôs elites as part of a plan to globally advance ‚Äútranshumanism‚Äù ‚Äî literally, the fusion of human beings with technology in an attempt to alter human nature itself.
Several scholars have been raising warning flags about this imminent possibility in respect to the coronavirus vaccines aggressively being rolled-out, particularly the Bill Gates-backed Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
Dr. Carrie Madej, an internist trained in osteopathic medicine, has expressed her urgent concerns in several videos, and interviews which have gained a strong circulating presence on social media for several months now. 
Both of these vaccines use a new ‚Äúmessenger RNA‚Äù technology (mRNA), which Madej states is important to know, ‚Äúbecause it could potentially alter our DNA, our genome.‚Äù And our human genome is what separates us from animals and plants. It is our ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù for how we develop, reproduce, function and repair ourselves. Therefore, ‚Äúone little change one little protein inserted, one taken out, can actually create a congenital defect or a hereditary disorder.‚Äù
This process is called ‚Äútransfection‚Äù and is the ‚Äúsame technology being used to make a genetically modified organism, such as a tomato or corn in the grocery store,‚Äù Madej said. Such modified organisms ‚Äúare not as healthy as the organic the wild type that you see out in nature,‚Äù thus, potentially, ‚Äúwe would not be as healthy.‚Äù
Dr. Lukacs points out how similar DNA modifying experiments have been performed on human embryos already. Culture-of-death scientists have been ‚Äúmixing genes with humans from monkeys and rats, with pigs because we want to harvest organs‚Ä¶‚Äù and then killing the embryos after 14 days.
The public is told, he says, that with respect to these vaccines, the mRNA ‚Äúwill go into the cell and instruct the DNA to code a particular protein, which will then fight against the virus.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut who can certify [for] us that this is the type of RNA they are manufacturing?‚Äù he asked. As the vaccine could carry RNA to do just about anything, including limiting ‚Äúour capacity to capture oxygen in the red (blood) cells,‚Äù or disrupt the ‚Äúphysiological process where you have to develop sperm. You never know. The sky is the limit,‚Äù he said.
As has long been an ethical concern with human genome research, the virtually limitless possibilities of this technology can be horribly abused. Such processes may be able to even compromise other features, such as one‚Äôs intelligence, and that of their offspring, creating even a class of sub-humans by combining human DNA with that of animals.
While vaccine manufacturers have denied that the mRNA in these vaccines will change one‚Äôs genome, Dr. Louis Fouch√©, a French anesthetist and resuscitation specialist said this can‚Äôt be known until it happens and we have long-term studies, highlighting another grave concern with such a rushed vaccine. In response to the same assertion, Dr. Madej, adds that with their expression of certainty on this question, these corporations are simply ‚Äúoutright lying.‚Äù";Michael Dautrich;0;
UgwyJaJZeG5HXcgG7Rh4AaABAg;2021-02-21T17:23:07Z;Great vid! I had a question about VPN though. You mentioned that if you're connected to the coffee shop's wifi, all your traffic is unencrypted and visible to other computers on the wifi network. So when you set up a vpn, surely there is an interim period where your traffic is visible before the vpn is enabled right? And how does the signal flow work in this scenario? Is it MyLaptop --> Wifi --> back to Laptop --> to VPN software on laptop --> back to Wifi. At which point, from hereon after, its VPN <--> wifi ?  Thanks in advance!;Yanik Jayaram;0;0
UgwlJR0rL7V_5pe_jet4AaABAg;2021-02-21T17:39:27Z;"Hi,  thanks for the video, although the colorblind example doesn't really work? The objective was to prove to the color blind person that the balls were two different colors. But the colorblind person could have been lied to each time by the woman since he can't validate the color himself.  Perhaps the example would've been better framed as, a group of color-seeing people individually vote on the green ball. If the balls were the same color, the group wouldn't be able to all vote for the same ball, proving to the colorblind dude that, in fact, the balls are of two different colors.
And separately, the non-interactive zero proof wasn't really explained? And you also mention at one point that it's beneficial because it's quick for nodes to process, but then later describe it as process intensive.
Clarity here would be appreciated. Thanks!";Yanik Jayaram;0;

What about prior immunity from either already having had it or from other coronaviruses? Wish it were all so nice and simple, but the machinery of the immune system is incredibly complex and isn't down to a few binary ""change this and that happens"" type events. It is interconnected and multifaceted, much of it is still not completely understood.

Well, to simplify my question, something like the oxford vaccine which is a viral vector vaccine, it carried the DNA into the cell by using another virus. That virus will get into the human cell itself. However, how can we make sure that the mRNA gets into the cell in order to create spike proteins for making people getting immunized? Otherwise, won't the mRNA just fell to some empty spaces between the cells?

UgzOQb2t1HslZpvisXd4AaABAg.8q59qsXatDW9K9G5U_zAUT;2021-02-24T17:39:33Z;"I can think of one zero-knowledge proof that is non-interactive that involves proving that one knows the prime factors of a number without revealing said prime factors, basically it's RSA signing with a twist. It goes like this:




Say you have the number N = 128423, and you want to prove that you know the prime factors without revealing any information about the primes themselves. Here's what you do


1. Since you know the factors are  769 * 167 = 128423, you can calculate the Euler totient to get (769-1) * (167-1) = 127488, we'll call this value _phi._
2. Now pick a public number _e_ which is coprime to phi, the easiest is a number like 65537 which is prime but greater that the square-root of phi.
3. Now calculate a secret number _d_ by taking the modlular inverse of _e_ modulo phi, this gives us 1/65537 = 54785 (mod 127488).
4. If we take any number _m_ and raise it to the power _d_ then do modulo N to get a new numer _s,_ doing the same with _s_ but with _e_ instead of _d_ we arrive back at _m._



m ^ d (mod N) = s
s ^ e (mod N) = m
For any m < N


We can calculate _s_ only by knowing _d,_ and knowing _d_ (combined with _e,_ which is public) is equivalent to knowing the factors of N.




Finally, let's try a practical example to demonstrate:


Here is a proof I know the prime factors of the number 5609654452760709630006622756892418841890735941208888880805793565319940075849799980043767420213243893:



N = 5609654452760709630006622756892418841890735941208888880805793565319940075849799980043767420213243893
e = 65537
s = 4691398041935726800648528142580678766790089967215103950511154552099580646783686977287224608076011797


The signature _s_ is of the number you get by coverting ""Hello, World!"" into ASCII-encoded binary taking the result as a number in base 2. That is, _m_ = encode(""Hello, World!""), _s_ = m ^ d (mod N). You can check this proof by taking  _m_ = s ^ e (mod N), then decoding m.



Unless I was *extremely* good at guessing, calculating _s_ is impossible without first knowing the prime factors of N.";deidara _;0;

*A million questions* : What ifs, long term questions,  and predictions. I am not a scientist,  but I do know how those vaccine *trials*  turned out. NONE of us know what's going to be happening in  2022 with our bodies. *No one* . Stop asking. *Relax* . We will get through this! I do feel that a vaccine may be a yearly event. *Until then* ,  I will continue to educate myself by keeping up to date on the most recent *facts*  on the  vaccines. I am not wondering around my city asking myself, *or* my doctor,  a million questions about what will happen to me after I get the vaccine,  because he is only going to repeat the *facts*  that I am already aware of ( *I hope* ). He's reading like I'm reading. He's learning like I am learning. I am at peace with my health,  prior to vaccine, and afterward. I still have to be good to myself. The vaccine is not a cure all. It's not even a cure for Covid-19. *There is no cure yet folks* . It is because of my *faith*  that *I think like this* :We know what we know. We will know more as time goes on. The virus is new to *everyone* , so no one will be able to answer about long term until time passes (long term).  I'm learning as I keep it moving. They did their trials. I didn't hear about anyone dying with them, but some had side affects. That's what we know. That's what the experts know. That's what my doctor know. Knowing that, I will pray that God keeps me here a long time. If he is ready for me, it's going to happen, *even if*  I don't get the vaccine. I am ready to get another step closer to visiting my family and friends without worrying about getting sick from Covid-19.  *It's an individual choice*  that a person will just have to decide on. When a certain amount is vaccinated, the masks *will*  come off. I *am not*  going to be one of those  paranoid (in store,on plane,in church, visting loved ones),  and *still wearing a mask, when CDC makes it optional*  for those vaccinated, for *fear*  that I may catch the Covid-19 . My eyes are on the future. I place *any* fear, with my *faith* .  Making travel plans with much more ease now. Stay safe.  God bless our world! Sorry about the length,  good people!";R o;1;

Also, fiber from, say London to Johannesburg gives you a latency of about 160ms, at least. Same distance using starlink gives you about 90ms (already, 03-2021). Latency will be lower as more sats are in (low-earth) orbit, in fact, ping-pongs of 8ms on ookla's test are physically possible when they start deploying lasers in between their sats.;Anonymous Pro;0;

Hard to see where a ""smart contract"" can do much more than a simple ""if"" and ""then"" transaction, such as a vending machine type of input, put in A, get B.  Anything requiring satisfaction of multiple conditions, such as a home purchase (inspections, financing, title evaluation, repairs, move-in inspection) would seem well beyond the capability of computer code, except to record and preserve the situation via inputs at the time.

The whole point of Starlink is for people like me that have no options. Obviously if we had cable or fiber we wouldn't be here. Hooking up with Cable/Fiber would be the correct way to go if you have those options because you don't pay those initial costs (800 dollars) and it's likely you would have plans under 100 dollars/mnth on them carriers. 
So since Starlink is our only option then it's worth every cent to us!

In all honesty though I don't care what they do in the future as of right now I'm always able to stream 4k video on all my TV's and use the internet at full speed so I'm good with what it is now!

Each virus has distinct protien spikes, flu spikes are different from ebola, earlier covid spikes are different from the mutated versions. If the coronavirus spikes mutate even more the vaccines will be ineffective because the mutated protien spikes will be completely different from what people are getting injected with.

Right now if a company wants to force you to provide certain data they have to adjust their system to force that and store that data, and there's no guarantee it's valid, while if this system becomes widely available they need no extra effort to block you out.



I recently got back into cryptocurrencies since 2017, to find out that every legalized method of purchasing any cryptocurrency requires you to provide every single personal detail about you (address, and copy of your ID), at least for my country. What used to be a step towards greater privacy for the consumer is now less secure than cash purchases.

Ugxu-5zkQED8oHhfCM94AaABAg.9Kn4kFwfmUN9Ko-sfFm24m;2021-03-12T22:45:58Z;mRNA (messenger RNA) is essentially an instruction of what proteins to build. These mRNA vaccines has codons of instructions on how to build the spike proteins that COVID19 viruses have which they use to attach to hosts' cells. So using the mRNA blueprint, it tells your cells to build and express the spike proteins which then your B-cells (memory cells) can recognize and prepare antibodies for. Once your immune system learns to recognize these spike proteins, it will be ready if you get infected with COVID. The B-cells will trigger the appropriate antibodies to attack the virus and destroy. The main issue is that COVID19 mutates time to time (in order to sustain better), creating different versions of these spike proteins.;JSK90589;0;

Ugwt4iSzK425KuA6YP94AaABAg.9CE3lBvEp_69Kri23OCBdM;2021-03-14T09:18:19Z;"@John Chan no, they wouldn‚Äôt, because the startups are producing something of direct economic value (well, for any startup that isn‚Äôt actually a Ponzi scheme), and the startup investor‚Äôs returns are based on either enterprise profits (for dividends) or market value of a proof of stake at transfer (stock appreciation). In a proof of work blockchain there‚Äôs the miners, who have no direct equivalent in a startup... they literally expand the share pool of a venture that makes nothing by exploiting energy arbitrage opportunities, then they sell shares they‚Äôve created out of thin air to late investors who purchase with cash, hoping those shares will appreciate because of FOMO demand pressure. The whole engine transfers late investors who stake in cash into the hands of early investors who stakes in mining pools... it‚Äôs a very modern twist on a Ponzi scheme. Proof of stake blockchains seem to be less schemish, especially ones with strong emphasis on smart contracts and the ledger itself as the product, rather than the token, but still as investment it‚Äôs a weird kind of risk... pretty much nobody actually understands that they‚Äôre banking on a very slow massively distributed database with eternally growing storage constraints that can be taken out by a substantial magnetic pulse or decent size solar storm. Plus everyone just seems to assume that network and mining pool attacks are economically infeasible when the proposal that you can just make up money is central to the idea.

Regardless, I don't think privacy is going to win out as a reason people pick one service over another in the near future.

Should I have expected the 11 March test for antibodies to be positive for antibodies? And what does it mean if it wasn't? (It was not positive for antibodies.) One more piece of information for others more knowledgeable than I and kind enough to comment. Prior to the vaccine I tested negative for COVID-19 several times and took one test for antibodies months before. All were negative. My bottom line curiosity is are you supposed to test positive for antibodies after having been fully vaccinated and did something go awry if you don't even after the appropriate time elapses?

While it is true that if they had the foresight to buy at economy of scale rates at the beginning, it would have favored them, that ship has sailed.  If part of the bargain to shift from proof of work, to proof of stake, is that we also use it on a lesser adopted currency, this seems to offer the rich another crack at bat now that the money is in it.  

I'd rather give them a slight advantage at procuring the last 3 million BTC while 18 million is more distributed than give them the opportunity to have an advantage based on who can come up with the biggest deposit, on the vast majority of the future total of a new crypto.";InAVanByTheRivr;0;

And if i have to transfer from one wallet to another why i pay gas, why can't i use same wallet adress and have my private keys of coin for access ? Kinda coin value is pointless from my perspective, it's just people printing money, but till every one uses just coins for purchase we have to convert to usd or eur so then value is again controled by goverment. So every contry then needs to use one type of coin in orded for no value to be controled by goverment.

The blockchain does not know, as you point out, that this wallet has not been made yet, so it has no idea whether some guy, e.g. you, will show up in the future to claim the money or not.

Both PoW and Pos require validating a new block in the same way. The difference is that in proof of work billions of calculations are done ""guessing"" the hash of the next block, and each guess requires a validation step to see if it was correct or not, and once that miner knows it has the correct answer it notifies all the others, who each run their own validation calculation. In Proof of Stake, it sounds like the guessing process is skipped entirely.

If they accept it, then their copy of the blockchain is the same as yours. If they reject it, then their copy of the blockchain starts to diverge from yours. So how does a 3rd party pick which blockchain is real? They pick the longer one. Who will have the longer one? Usually whoever has more computing power. So ""consensus"" on which blockchain is legitimate is determined by computing power. If a party has 51% of the computing power, then others are most likely to accept their version of the blockchain, would theoretically allow them to double-spend, or block transactions of parties they don't like.";Rumford Chimpenstein;0;

How do you know they are ""people""? How do you know they are not all the same ""person""?

""Set you back a whopping 79 billion dollars. So the 51% is actually a lot less likely to happen with Proof of Stake."".

The US government, by itself, just printed 2 trillion dollars, and this guy is claiming that it's ""not likely"" for an entity to obtain 79 billion?

This would be TRIVIAL to do.

The government can print ANY amount of money it wants, at ANY time. And they have FIRST access. So that money isn't even hitting inflation right away, which makes it hard to detect.

They could even buy it up under a million different nodes. How would we ever know they are even doing this?

Ugw1QV1hJiRsxj_8UrN4AaABAg;2021-03-21T14:36:08Z;"mRNA gene altering technology was introduced world-wide in November 2020.

There is no going back now for those who have allowed themselves to be made a part of this DNA editing experiment.

In an article in Scientific America in 2018 it exposed that they needed an excuse to start expanding their research in altering Humans.

In January 2020 they created the ‚ÄúEMERGENCY‚Äù that removed ALL restraints from testing on humans and they are not even liable for any harm they cause.

The following is from Scientific America.

‚ÄúNovember 2018, a Chinese scientist, He Jiangxi, caused an international uproar by announcing the birth of two babies whose DNA he had edited using a tool called CRISPR-Cas9. Human germline genome editing‚Äîthat is, making precise changes in human DNA that can be passed down through generations‚Äîhas been seen for decades as a line that should not be crossed. This past December, He was sentenced to three years in prison for carrying out an ‚Äúillegal medical practice.‚Äù
Yet, as the Chinese experiment shows, the state of technology no longer bars those who are willing to cross it. He‚Äôs experiment was a profound scientific and ethical misstep. Not only did he do it before adequate preparatory studies had been undertaken, but he acted unilaterally, deploying a technology with the potential to affect deeply held beliefs about human life all around the planet. His experiment set a dangerous example for other overly eager scientists. In mid-2019, a Russian scientist proposed a similar experiment.
We cannot blame lax oversight on China alone. The scientist who carried out the controversial first experiment in China was trained at U.S. universities using science and technology developed in the U.S., and he consulted with U.S. colleagues before conducting his study. Yet, so far we have largely let prominent scientists and scientific institutions frame the discussion around genome editing.‚Äù";Maranatha2020 Jesus;0;

Plasma cells are actually just another name for effector B cells. I'd say they're still B cells that just has a different function than their counterpart, memory B cells. Both differentiate after activation which can occur either through direct contact with the pathogen or stimulation by an effector helper T cell. Both memory and effector B cells still produce antibodies, but what makes memory T cells different is that if they encounter the pathogen again, they differentiate into effector cells without going through the long process.";Robin Avarin;0;

Foreign Keys would need to be hashed that way as well, but you lose the neat splitting across partitions. Or else then you would have to duplicate data....  On top of all that you would need some conflict resolution on the hashing function for keys that produce the same hash result. So it is not quite so simple. All in all it is all swings and roundabouts. You need to look at various combinations of warehousing options to suit your needs.

The main one being that they are very slow in input (write) operations, making them unusable for most real life use - no supermarket chain or telecomm company would use a NoSQL database to capture real time transactions.

UgwHZWuO1vi1sCdpB0h4AaABAg;2021-03-24T19:54:52Z;"One problem is that the Y shaped antibodies (called in the literature non-neutralizing antibodies because they loosely bind to the mRNA injected program encased in an artificial lipid called ""hydrogel"" and then release the mRNA inside the cytoplasm where it is released to mass produce itself) also ""attack"" the type 2 white blood cells in the lungs (using the FAC stem of the antibody) which essentially do

 1). the clean up work after the more aggressive type 1 white blood cells which are extremely aggressive in attacking pathogens which cause infections and 
2). shut down the type 1 white blood cells to prevent them from killing the host.

In animal studies involving mRNA vaccines it was found that after the pathogen supposedly protected by the vaccine that 100% of the treatment group animals died after exposure to the pathogen in question.  The lungs examined found only type 1 white blood cells and NO type 2 white blood cells.

In the control group (the animals that did not get the mRNA vaccine) and were ALSO exposed to the pathogen, both type 1 AND type 2 white blood cells were found in the lungs and 100% of these test animals survived.

Also according to the CDC's own statistics within the first 30 days of the introduction of the mRNA vaccine into the US over 40,000 cases of adverse effects were documented ant that is estimated as less than 1% of what ""they"" believe actually occurred.

UgzEaPQHOFJB89DMXhp4AaABAg.9LGxkEtcrJC9LJT-O_edP5;2021-03-25T13:16:07Z;True - This worked very well in the mid-1970's when computer resources were extremely limited / expensive. I designed a simple hash within a custom access method for storing & retrieving all medical & dental claims history, as part of a software package for our client, for Equitable Ins.  The file size was 16X IBM's max at that time, even after data compression & spanning multiple hard drives!  So part of the hash was which of the 16 physical files the data was in.  In testing we achieved an average of 1.07 physical (system level) read requests per logical application request -- before a cache was added!  Code was also tight -- about 50 Assembly Language instructions to calc physical record # (or block), and about 70 AL / machine instructions within the IBM access method (BDAM) to convert our record # to CHR (Cylinder / Head / Record).  This was still in use in the 1990's.;mikeofallon;0;

It is to give people an incentive to use IPFS and serve those files.
Additionally, having a browser-mined coin for those _viewing_ but not _serving_ would accomplish nothing.
The entire purpose of IPFS is to have people download and serve to increase availability (and as a result, speed).
Additionally, it's pretty peer-to-peer.
If I visit an IPFS-enabled website, I download the stuff it needs, then serve them myself (until I delete it ofc).

Also, they can't really close down or block IPFS, which is also what it was designed for.
I mean, how can they block it? Just look at BitTorrent, they aren't able to block that either and well, torrents are far, far more notorious for illegal stuff.
They can't close it down either, because it's open-source, so people would just fork and continue on as usual.

And it probably already hosts a bunch of illegal stuff, you can never prevent that.
Then again, every ""censorship resistant protocol"" is prone to this.
Just look at ActivityPub (which is a W3C-recommended protocol), BitTorrent, TOR (more or less), Most cryptocurrencies etc. etc.
And even *if* you manage to block it, it's a matter of time before a workaround will be found, which is exactly why those protocols are so powerful.";Aroop Roelofs;2;

IPFS can be ran standalone just fine like I do.
It wasn't designed to give more money to the whales, it's just a side-effect of FileCoin, which is a seperate project.

Also, I never said IPFS was *fast*, I only said that by having more people serve a file, the *faster* it becomes.
Faster, being a relative term.

Also, they haven't blocked torrents lmao.
In Germany, you can torrent just fine (I use torrents to send stuff like documents and some tools I made between a bunch of friends).
Yes, they have blocked sites like TPB but they have not blocked the BitTorrent protocol.
They can fine you based on things like finding you in the DHT for a specific (known illegal) file and/or scraping you from trackers.
They can't fine you for using the protocol itself (else using the Blizzard Launcher would get you fined since that uses the BitTorrent protocol under the hood as well).

Also, they can't really done it that easily.
How would they? Blocking IPFS specifically would mean blocking the underlying connection protocol (be it TCP/IP or UDP).
They can block commonly used ports, but at that point, just swap ports.
They can block every port but the ones they allow, but at that point, a lot of different stuff will also start breaking.

The Great Firewall of China does exactly this, block a lot of ports and only allowing a select few, that they can monitor heavily (for obvious reasons).
Do that in, let's say Germany or The Netherlands and well... you're bound to cause massive uproar.
And ofc, as you know, in China, they'd probably just gun you down if you start rioting buuut that's a different topic.

the mRNA literally has no reason to go inside the nucleus, it legit cannot do anything once inside

the mRNA's job is to assist in the production of proteins, hence it goes to the ribosome, the part of the cells that synthesis proteins.

even IF it could enter the nucleus, it likely wouldnt do anything, instead just floating around before getting destroyed by its own instability. 

Human mRNA does not stay in the nucleus for long at all, leaving once it has finished being made, so why would an already made virus mRNA have any reason to go into the nucleus? It's literally not what mRNA does.

Are there other reasons to be skeptical? Sure, but the gene therapy one is based off of objectivally false science, and is likely being promoted by a grifter.

1) Data partitioning was introduced in sql rdbms in the 1990's, and it constantly extended since then.
(baded on hash, vatue, time, etc)

2) Sharding of complete sql rdbms was introduced since 2010.
And even before that, there were ""distributed rdbmd"", were you _may_ have to code some conflict resolution, if necessary. With nosql, that's what you begin with, mendatorily at day 2.

3) In the very moment, one data atom has just one hint of relation to another data atom, and both are stored as key-value/nosql data lumps, you are lost: A change happens? Good luck finding all lumps that need to be changed as well, and not forgetting some. New to the kv-data/nosql-store? Good luck reading and understanding all the code, that if, _if_ it's readable (ie source fully available, well written, no tricks, no dynamic code generation, not too many lines). If zo extend/change a unknowm system's data handling, it's hard/ impossible, if the truth is buried in the code, not in the data model. And giod luck findingvand fixing bugs in conjuntion to nosql.

You nosql guys always forget, that you are no gods:
Nobody codes perfect, no system does not change, you don't know next year's or decade's usage of the data you just lump together, you don't live forever, and costumers are extremely unwise to rely on individuals and there tricks.
But , hey: No cumbersome thinking about the data and it's meaning and usage, just agile straight-forward coding from day 1.

UgwEre0N4wXSCxKhow14AaABAg.9LNxa0dRDDA9LTK9a-hW8u;2021-03-29T09:11:16Z;"It depends upon the hash formula used, particularly how the hash value is assigned to the groups.

In [the] Pick[s I've used] the hash value of the item ID is taken modulo the number of groups.  To change the number of groups requires copying the data to a new file created with the new modulo (often done on a system restore, eg when a new 16 port board had been added).

In the multivalue database I use at home it auto resizes by using a hashing algorithm that always allocates an item ID to the same bucket but many buckets can be stored in each primary group of the file (making use of hash collision), and when a group requires splitting, an extra primary group is added to the file and the items in the bucket(s) that should be in this new group are split from the group they were in.

Similarly when the file shrinks and primary groups are no longer needed, the reverse occurs combining two ""related"" groups.";Cigmorfil;0;
Ugyp666i18Y5f1uT0gp4AaABAg.9LEE7fgVqOE9LTKYhRWjO7;2021-03-29T09:14:42Z;"Pick works quite well with hashing to a group which then stores the whole of the data item, with multiple items in a group just stored one after the other in the group,  linking extra frames from the overflow spare frames of disk space.

A file with 23 groups is guaranteed to have hash collision with 24 items stored in it...";Cigmorfil;0;1
UgxRlz0Ytt5cNw-eosZ4AaABAg.9LId4gwU3uw9LTMciZ0DmO;2021-03-29T09:32:52Z;"In Pick the primary (only) key is the Item ID (denoted as attribute (or field) 0).  The item ID can be anything you like.  When an item is stored in a file a hash function is performed on this item ID which is then used to determine into which group (partition) of the file to place the item.

When accessing the data in a file, an attribute of the file can contain the item ID (primary key) of an item in another file.   You can define ""dictionary"" items which can pull data from another file based on the item ID found in the given attribute of an item in the current file.

Each Pick file is like a SQL table, except that no structure is imposed on each table (upto the programmer to ensure data integrity) and each attribute can be multivalue - eg an attribute of a customer can contain a list of their orders and when listing the customer file those orders can all be accessed from the single customer entry, pulling across the attributes as required (similar to, but not quite the same as a sql join).";Cigmorfil;0;

I.e. if your cells continue to synthesize spike proteins after the B memory cells are established/antibodies are produced, that seems like there could be a potential for autoimmune disorders (i.e. the cell-mediated arm of the adaptive immune system triggering cytotoxic T cells to kill your own cells still containing those spike proteins)?. B cells are the humoral arm of adaptive immunity, but I am wondering where MHC's (Major histocompatibility complex) proteins come into play here?

I've been studying how these vaccines work, and the many potential pitfalls this last year.  One thing I keep seeing in the normie friendly releases is that this is a big money saving benefit for pharma, if they can use synthetic, or largely synthetic gene based vaccines.  They can do it quicker, saving money, they they don't have to take months to culture viruses, more money saved. At our expense, they'd like the quickest cheapest route to bio-engineer some still poorly understood, and not at all long range tested, gene therapies.

if you have a very simple website with no large user base and you are ok withup to 3 minutes of downtime a day,  just pay the 50 bucks startup costs and get a raspi, an extra ethernet cable, a usb drive, an sd card and a case (and maybe some cooling idk)  and take the 2-3 ish hours to configure it all then you are up and running for basically no costs.

So if  my understanding is correct, the mRNA vaccine will deliver the mRNA for the spike proteins into the cell cytoplasm where the endoplasmic reticuluum will read the mRNA and translate it and it results in the spike proteins which we will use to prepare for the actual covid virus particle. Again, it's been a while since I had to study this and it's a very simplistic explanation with some parts left out, but I hope that helped you understand! feel free to do your own research and correct me if I'm wrong!";Jason;0;

People forced to where masks containing graphene particles. None of these issues on masks alone are being reported fully or allowed to be discussed in full allowing people to make up their own minds. We could go back and forth disagreeing on this and all areas of this so called Covid-19 pandemic and that is fine to a point. But when I and anyone else who wishes to question to the full extent what is being imposed on people and Youtube, Twitter, Facebook etc are deplatforming people, banning them, comments removed, cannot use certain words, discuss certain topics or people, see previously available reference material altered or removed etc. Then the one sided narrative being peddled is just one big lie.;RonniePeterson;1;

1.  Assuming that everyone on earth got infected, we know that 94% of deaths were from people who had 2.9 comorbidities (directly from the CDC's website).  So the 2% ratio average is inaccurate and dramatically skews the death total you projected.
2.  MRNA vaccines have not been approved by the FDA.  If you go to the FDA factsheets, you'll see them listed as unapproved,  for emergency release only.  
3.  We don't know the long-term effects these synthetic biologics have on our immune systems because this is the first time they've been used on humans and especially en masse.  We actually don't know how each person will develop their unique responses over time which could lead to severe autoimmune issues.

I think the video is BS because it talks about NoSQL database as if there is one big category of them. Which is not. The only thing NoSQL database have in common is that they do not implement the relational model. Not all NoSQL scale out, not all NoSQL database don't use SQL, not all NoSQL databases work with semi-or unstructured data.;Tina M;0;

UgyBpY0v9GRRsHguHoB4AaABAg;2021-04-17T01:07:41Z;"A December preprint about SARS-CoV-2, by scientists at Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), produced findings about wild coronavirus that raise questions about how viral RNA operates.

The scientists conducted the analysis because they were ‚Äúpuzzled by the fact that there is a respectable number of people who are testing positive for COVID-19 by PCR long after the infection was gone.‚Äù

Their key findings were as follows: SARS-CoV-2 RNAs ‚Äúcan be reverse transcribed in human cells,‚Äù ‚Äúthese DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed‚Äù (a phenomenon called ‚Äúretro-integration‚Äù) ‚Äî and there are viable cellular pathways to explain how this happens.

According to Ph.D. biochemist and molecular biologist Dr. Doug Corrigan, these important findings (which run contrary to ‚Äúcurrent biological dogma‚Äù) belong to the category of ‚ÄúThings We Were Absolutely and Unequivocally Certain Couldn‚Äôt Happen Which Actually Happened.‚Äù

The findings of the Harvard and MIT researchers also put the CDC‚Äôs assumptions about mRNA vaccines on shakier ground, according to Corrigan. In fact, a month before the Harvard-MIT preprint appeared, Corrigan had already written a blog outlining possible mechanisms and pathways whereby mRNA vaccines could produce the identical phenomenon.

In a second blog post, written after the preprint came out, Corrigan emphasized that the Harvard-MIT findings about coronavirus RNA have major implications for mRNA vaccines ‚Äî a fact he describes as ‚Äúthe big elephant in the room.‚Äù While not claiming that vaccine RNA will necessarily behave in the same way as coronavirus RNA ‚Äî that is, permanently altering genomic DNA ‚Äî Corrigan believes that the possibility exists and deserves close scrutiny.

In Corrigan‚Äôs view, the preprint‚Äôs contribution is that it ‚Äúvalidates that this is at least plausible, and most likely probable.‚Äù

Reverse transcription
As the phrase ‚Äúreverse transcription‚Äù implies, the DNA-to-mRNA pathway is not always a one-way street. Enzymes called reverse transcriptases can also convert RNA into DNA, allowing the latter to be integrated into the DNA in the cell nucleus.

Nor is reverse transcription uncommon. Geneticists report that ‚ÄúOver 40% of mammalian genomes comprise the products of reverse transcription.‚Äù

The preliminary evidence cited by the Harvard-MIT researchers indicates that endogenous reverse transcriptase enzymes may facilitate reverse transcription of coronavirus RNAs and trigger their integration into the human genome.

The authors suggest that while the clinical consequences require further study, detrimental effects are a distinct possibility and ‚Äî depending on the integrated viral fragments‚Äô ‚Äúinsertion sites in the human genome‚Äù and an individual‚Äôs underlying health status ‚Äî could include ‚Äúa more severe immune response ‚Ä¶ such as a ‚Äòcytokine storm‚Äô or auto-immune reactions.‚Äù

In 2012, a study suggested that viral genome integration could ‚Äúlead to drastic consequences for the host cell, including gene disruption, insertional mutagenesis and cell death.‚Äù

Corrigan makes a point of saying that the pathways hypothesized to facilitate retro-integration of viral ‚Äî or vaccine ‚Äî RNA into DNA ‚Äúare not unknown to people who understand molecular biology at a deeper level.‚Äù

Even so, the preprint‚Äôs discussion of reverse transcription and genome integration elicited a maelstrom of negative comments from readers unwilling to rethink biological dogma, some of whom even advocated for retraction (though preprints are, by definition, unpublished) on the grounds that ‚Äúconspiracy theorists ‚Ä¶ will take this paper to ‚Äòproof‚Äô that mRNA vaccines can in fact alter your genetic code.‚Äù

More thoughtful readers agreed with Corrigan that the paper raises important questions. For example, one reader stated that confirmatory evidence is lacking ‚Äúto show that the spike protein only is expressed for a short amount of time (say 1-3 days) after vaccination,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúWe think that this is the case, but there is no evidence for that.‚Äù

JH Weston Show
In fact, just how long the vaccines‚Äô synthetic mRNA ‚Äî and thus the instructions for cells to keep manufacturing spike protein ‚Äî persist inside the cells is an open question.

Ordinarily, RNA is a ‚Äúnotoriously fragile‚Äù and unstable molecule. According to scientists, ‚Äúthis fragility is true of the mRNA of any living thing, whether it belongs to a plant, bacteria, virus or human.‚Äù

But the synthetic mRNA in the COVID vaccines is a different story. In fact, the step that ultimately allowed scientists and vaccine manufacturers to resolve their decades-long mRNA vaccine impasse was when they figured out how to chemically modify mRNA to increase its stability and longevity ‚Äî in other words, produce RNA ‚Äúthat hangs around in the cell much longer than viral RNA, or even RNA that our cell normally produces for normal protein production.‚Äù

It is anyone‚Äôs guess what the synthetic mRNA is doing while it is ‚Äúhanging around,‚Äù but Corrigan speculates that its enhanced longevity raises the probability of it ‚Äúbeing converted over into DNA.‚Äù

Moreover, because the vaccine mRNA is also engineered to be more efficient at being translated into protein, ‚Äúnegative effects could be more frequent and more pronounced with the vaccine when compared to the natural virus.‚Äù";Raziel VinGrimm;0;1

3. Now you want to send some coins to Alex , you have to provide your address , your privateKey and Alex's address

So she models the adoption curve.  He reckons adoption is still in full swing, and her ""moving target"" is currently a price of $300K at end of 2021.  She also mentioned that the $1 trillion market cap is a barrier - that there would be a lot of resistance to falling below $55K.

All it is in the instruct for the body to make the part of the virus that actually attaches to the body, not the actual virus itself (there are inactivated virus vaccines being developed but they haven't been approved yet). So when the virus does actually enter the body, it won't be able to bind and start replicating within the cells. 

The spike protein existing on its own with no other parts of SARS-CoV-2 is pratically useless. The ""side-effects"" may be as a result of the ingridents used to deliver the vaccine (the lipid which some may be allergic to), rather than the actual vaccine itself.";shakey;0;

Intake reduction, your not getting your normal amount of gasses and oxygen. When you take in less tour body works harder to correct itself. So puts you in a state of panic. As far as your body knows, its being deprived air. So it will put out an alert, and this is constant when wearing a mask. Putting you at more risk when you actually encounter a virus or anything else on top of this threat your bodies already dealing with. So your not gonna get full response, as you would, if no mask. All doctors and common sense tells you not to prohibit breathing. If your at rest your breathing shallow as it is , so to hinder in top of that .,not good. If exercising and breathing hard, thus hindrance is bad, not good. By promoting this nonsense of wearing mask is a detriment to your health. Anyone not telling you that, does not have your best interest at heart. Or they are intentually telling you this and actually trying to harm you;Scott Menard;0;

But if I accept that it does ,  I can't find any info on how many cells are injected, or how many spike proteins are produced.   I've  heard virologists voice alarm that huge numbers of  spike proteins will be created by the artificial vaccine process. 

Yes, the spikes  themselves are useless , but once the cell which produced them begins to die , some of the spike proteins or fragments of them, may be free floating in the body.  If your immune system doesn't catch them all ,  will they eventually lodge in blood vessels, lungs etc causing inflammation ?

Well, the mRNA only has one purpose, to create spike proteins, when it runs out of RNA instructions, it stops making spike proteins.
All spike proteins are destroyed by the immune system.

UgwPQodqaJhiH4Bsm2h4AaABAg;2021-04-27T04:16:42Z;"This is an extension of the colorblind analogy for NON-INTERACTIVE ZK Proof:

1) Replace your colorblind friend (the challenger) with a desktop computer. Its screen is described as follows:
   * There are 2 buttons: ""prover"" and ""verifier."" You, the prover, must click the ""prover"" button.
   * It requires a password. Type anything you like, like ""can_distinguish_red_and_green!"".
   * Then the desktop computer will generate a (long) series of stock footages of someone taking the 2 balls, either switching it or not on his/her back, and showing it back to you. Note that you only see the front of the man/woman in the stock footage.
   * 3 crucial properties about the desktop computer: (1) same password input, same series output, (2) the series of stock footages is random in a sense that it is ""impossible"" to deduce the password from it (this ""randomness"" prevents you from cheating), and (3) if you just made an incorrect character in inputting the password, the series will change drastically.
2) You list your test answers in a paper like this: ""Switched, Not Switched,  Not Switched, ...""
3) You broadcast the password and your test answers publicly.

Now for a colorblind person to verify:

1) Everyone has access to the SAME desktop computer. Colorblind person clicks ""verifier"".
2) Person inputs the broadcasted password correctly.
3) Then the desktop computer will generate a (long) series of stock footages of someone taking the 2 balls, bla bla bla... but this time, the person only sees the BACK of the man/woman in the stock footage, so the colorblind person can see if the man/woman switches the balls or not.
4) From the crucial property (1) of the computer, the colorblind person can now verify the broadcasted test answers!

This desktop computer is the analogy for the so-called ""random oracle model"", which is crucial for the security of this protocol.

You don‚Äôt know where the mRNA is going or for how long you‚Äôll produce the spike protein. This can have deadly effects in the body, as the real virus only attacks lung cells. The mRNA can attack neurones, kidney cells, spleen cells, etc.. with the real virus you develop strong immunity to the whole virus (the strongest immunity) in about three days. From day six or seven it‚Äôs just the body recovering. With the mRNA you can be infected continuously, making it impossible to donate blood for people that need it.

UgxyaxyOwOYmJZVXHfV4AaABAg;2021-05-01T16:10:40Z;Excellent mini lecture for non-scientists ! But I heard that once cells in our bodies generate the spike protein following an mRNA vaccine shot, some or all of these proteins are not really excreted and then attacked by the immune system. Instead, these proteins are attacked while they are still attached to the cells that generate them. This could well acount for most side effects, because our immune system actually attacks all the cells with spike proteins still protruding on them. These cells can be endothelial cells lining the inside of alll our blood vessels. This is why some people, if on the more serious side, can have blood clotting. When this happens in the brain, one may have really intense headache. Will this same mechanism do harm to the reproductive system but one does not know this until they want to have babies? However, I hope and still trust with moderate level of confidence that this should be rare, if exists. However, I hope the second shot should have a lower dose to minimize this risk. Lowering the second dose might not lower the protection too much, but will make the vaacination safer.;Xi Han;0;

UgzhV-p3oo9f6iwlxSt4AaABAg;2021-05-02T00:37:05Z;People are still getting symptoms from the mRNA vaccine, although this video say they shouldn't. Why is that?;keyring86;2;
Ugz9gZuqYEU2jbeBbCx4AaABAg;2021-05-02T02:10:42Z;Not sure why this video says that traditional vaccines can give mild symptoms but implies that mRNA vaccines don't . They can both give mild symptoms and often do.  Fatigue and fever etc are very common among those who get these vaccines and it goes away in a day or two. The actual virus often causes extreme fatigue that last for 2-3 weeks and obviousy worse.;John Fox;0;

UgwtJ6YJduH2akjM5VF4AaABAg;2021-05-02T05:19:12Z;Mining pools are basically workers unions‚Äîand they compete with one another. For instance, HiveOS competes with Nicehash currently as well as many other pools to secure Ethereum nodes. These pools are made up of many different individual miners. If a majority of individuals in any particular pool are dissatisfied with the way the pool is being run, they can change pools or force the pool owners to make a change. Seems as though this would actually PREVENT centralization because individuals are given the power to chose which pool to belong to. Proof of work also focuses more computing power on each individuals node(which of course uses more electricity, as you noted), but wouldn‚Äôt it also promote higher accuracy of work and increased network security? Proof of stake seems to promote monopolization by whomever has the biggest stick to swing around. Will this not lead to one large mining pool centralizing control and monopoly over every Ethereum transaction moving forward? I could be wrong...I‚Äôm just trying to think critically about this.;Jack Salamone;0;

You see the vaccine is at least manmade, with an efficacy to limit side effects and made to be as safe as possible. Yes,the vaccine contains some of the RNA of the virus, but you want the whole virus instead ?
Its a wild animal, with both short and long term effects.

If the cells so vaccinated are never destroyed I am assuming they do die eventually. So the spike protein is not in fact continuously produced right? So really the vaccinated cells produce the spike protein for as long as they are alive which give the immune system enough time to creat antibodies against the virus and this the is like all the other vaccines, in essence. The immune system is now armed to recognize and destroy with antibodies the virus containing this spike on it. As far as auto immune disease...I would think that is possible with any vaccine and any immune system stimulation. I still have no idea which cells are actually so called vaccinated...any cell, T cells only,  B cells only. How long do these cells hang around and produce the spike protein for...if only a couple a weeks enough for body to create antibodies then prob no different from any vaccine BUT if they keep reproducing into more cells which had the mean in them and thus the spike protein is constantly being produced then the immune system is a constant onslaught of this virus and in this hyper state of restimulation my thoughts are that a greater danger for autoimmune problems could occur. There should be a clear answer to this as as you said this is not new technology.;Cristina Valas;0;

Unfortunately, the whole Western world does not seem to care about this environmentally damaging process while voting for green parties and fighting climate change. I am so happy I have discovered the alternatives exist. But they seem to be still marginal without much impact on the mainstream. I wish more people would act responsibly in accordance to their green/leftist/liberal politic preferences. And more media would highlight the problems, promotingenvironmentally friendlier options. How come banks, investment funds etc. are audited and vetted according their green performance but all this stops when the cryptos seem to be an antouchable topic. And the best alternative would be to connect scientific computations like Boinc or World Community Grid to cryptos. But  nobody seems to care in the mainstream..;aswler;0;0

Consider I have ""cache aside pattern"" and ""in memory cache"" in application server is used. I'm looking for Invalidation logic when there is an update. This was the context.

I read for critical data like password/financial information we use Write Back policy to ensure consistency. In write through one instance's in memory cache entry gets updated and others can remain stale. So, there is inconsistency in write through

My question is same can happen in Write Back, one instance's in memory cache entry gets deleted(invalidated) and we update DB..other instances in memory cache still have that entry. So there is inconsistency in write Back as well? Why do we prefer write back for critical data because same issue is there in write back.
If answer is invalidate all instances' in memory cache entry then same can be done for Write through. Which makes me ask question 2.

My another question is : We can update all instances' in memory cache entry and then update DB. In this way consistency is maintained so why not we use Write through for critical data like password financial information?";Manisha Mulchandani;0;0

Most people just cheer but little number of them question!

The mRNA gets destroyed inside the cell after the cell produces the spike protein.(that's generally how it works with messenger RNAs)

""Which cell types end up manufacturing the spike proteins?"" Exactly! And they don't seem like talking about it without having their videos and articles removed or censored or not being ordered in google search results! Disgusting!

""Do they display this spike protein on their surface, or do they excrete the protein?"" Exactly! According to the scientific and official articles I have read, they appear on the surface of the mRNA-targeted cells. This means those cells can be targeted by any type of viruses that use that specific spike protein to inject its genome to the cell for mass production. Like a channel under the walls of city that can be abused by any enemy who knows that channel. From 5:52 of this video it expresses as if the spike proteins are exerted from the cell!!";Farshad S;1;

1. Do we for sure know which cell types end up targeted by the mRNA and manufacturing the spike proteins?
If we don't know for at least 99.99% then it is a dangerous method. What if red blood cells, ... become the spike protein factory?!!

2. Are the spike proteins appear on the surface of the mRNA-targeted cells thus get their structure modified, or do such cells completely excrete the protein even from the surface?
If (also) on the surface, then it is a dangerous method. This means those modified cells can be targeted by any type of viruses that use that specific spike protein to inject its genome to the cell for mass production. Like a channel under the walls of a city that can be abused by any enemy who knows that channel.

3. If there are mutations in the covid10 virus that modifies or dumps this specific signature spike protein, then all those covid19 injections will be to some extent or completely useless!!
Then we have to inject again with a new vaccine and a new spike proteins. I understand that this is multiplicatively benefitial in long term for that sect of the pharma which produces mRNA vaccines.";Farshad S;0;0

I am aware virus can be isolated, I am aware the SARS COV2 virus was not isolated in any country in the world, there is no proof of isolation to be found in any medical journal. Isolation equals publication, no publication of proof means no isolation.

In order to know that they are dealing with a corona virus, they must isolate the virus and analyze its characteristics, to see if they match the corona viruses or if its a new type of virus.

So if they did not isolate the SARS COV 2(covid 19) virus, how did they get the RNA code of the virus spike protein?

Is this coming from the covid virus RNA or  are they  not using the SARS COV2 virus DNA/RNA at all?

So how did they manage to get or make an RNA to put it in a nanocapsule, without having isolated / analyzed and tested the virus i am curious.";errol Andrews;0;1

So when a cell starts producing something weird, that is a sign there is an infection going on. It will stop producing the protein when it receives new instructions.

While it is capable of killing SARS-CoV-2 viruses in a laboratory environment, the doses required in a human to clear the infection would be fatal to the human. Like many treatments out there, Ivermectin basically hopes to kill the parasite before it kills the host. With normal parasites, it works well enough. But for a virus, which is much more rugged and will have al ot more material spread throughout the body, Ivermectin just can't get the job done before killing the host.;Jarynn;1;0

Those symptoms are your immune system going to work. Fatigue from your body directing all available resources to the immune system. Inflammation from cells rushing to the site of the infection. Reduced appetite because your body doesnt have time to digest food and thus stops asking for food, and if you eat anyway, your body will reject it and cause you to vomit it back up. And fever because viruses and bacteria cannot reproduce as effectively in a hot environment, so your entire body heats up to make the body less hospitable. So yeah, when the vaccine triggers an immune reaction, it will trigger the whole range of symptoms because, as far as your body is concerned, this is a real and serious threat.;Jarynn;0;0

To assume that I would take data from antivaxxers or that I am an antivaxxer or that antivaxxers don't have real data, puts you in a league of unreliable and biased analyzer or suer. To conclude that the biggest part of your clientele doesn't have real data, makes you a not so good businessman.

Show me the data you have that Sars COV2 (covid 19) virus exista and ill show you the faults in those data, then you may rephrase who the false data belongs to.

""There is no statistical difference in life expectancy from non covid deaths between vaccinated and unvaccinated people."" Statistic is no undeniable proof. Any one can make a statistic chart, that doesn't mean it is factual, or conclusions taken from them are correct.

If you are aware of how natural  death occurs, I can enlighten you that natural death no one dies suddenly, it takes time and stages before someone finally dies. What we are seeing around the world is people suddenly dying after taking the vaccines, dying alone having not time to ask for help or say goodby. These are not statistics pur real live evidence. Pregnant ladies loosing the unborn child. Real witness account of vaccine damages.

Before vaccines existed people would live longer, and less types of disease. Test has been done and comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated also has been done, but this info would note be easily shared.

The body then treats the mass amount of spikes as it would treat any foreign invader in your body.  The virus normally is multiplying out of control by your own infected cells so you get ill for a long time, compared to the relatively controlled creation of spike proteins.  So if you do get flu-like symptoms, they shouldnt last more than a couple days as the body has less work to do, it's still doing the same job, just much quicker.;deathstr1ker6666;0;

2.) So if eventually your immune system destroys the Spike RNA in your cell, does that mean your immune system attacks your cells to get to the Spike RNA? How does your immune system destroy the spike RNA in your cell l if it is encoded into your cell?";Kevo 5545;2;0

UgzHExUz5PgWUuFQIb54AaABAg;2021-05-20T11:32:19Z;"Does Proof-of-Stake really prevent fraudulent blocks from being entered into the blockchain though? 

As far as I know, with Proof-of-Work, the blocks are continually checked, as it is the blocks with the most computing behind them that are trusted. This means that in order to enter false blocks, and keep them there, one would have to give continuously have to compute more than the entire rest of the network combined. Not very practical, though I assume this is why the 51% attack is theoretically possible. 

With PoS however, it sounds like it is completely possible for a validator to enter a fraudulent block, so long as they are willing to accept losing the stake they initially put in? Wouldn't that allow a malicious actor to essentially ""buy"" fraudulent blocks on the chain, thus undermining the entire principle that it should be impossible to enter false information into the blockchain? Not only that, but if an actor enters a false block how would the network even detect that block at all?";Ashadow Reviews;0;0

UgxUVOFHtdX24OpVYCl4AaABAg.9K4Gt3xRzBD9N_UFB-Ye9l;2021-05-20T20:56:53Z;"Incorrect.  This vaccine set wasn't rushed at all.  mRNA vaccines simply have the ability to be synthesized far more efficiently and effectively as opposed to typical watered down viral loads which then have to be studied and tested for efficacy.  mRNA would seem to do the reverse.  The body is told how to do a thing (the mRNA instruction sets) and then a cell can be exposed to the virus to test.  As opposed to the cell being exposed to the virus and then determining how best to provoke the immune response.

Think of it like this - you know a flood is coming your way.  Your home has the potential to be flooded or be in the path.  Typical vaccines would wait to see the flood before taking any action at all to shore up, and by that time you will suffer greatly as you try to shore up to prevent it from becoming much worse.  mRNA vaccines would have already put up sandbags in preparation, regardless of whether the flood came your way or not.  If the flood did happen your way, you already have the prep set up AND now can shore up even more as needed because you're 10 steps ahead of it.  Some water will get through (see: side effects) but the leakage will be exponentially minimal and easily contained.";BigDaddyJinx;1;

UgwVhVo-uufsTyWiQjB4AaABAg.9NB4eAW3Fo79N_VBeDBRUm;2021-05-20T21:05:09Z;"Because the vaccines are currently being used to provide specific instructions to the body.  Do this and only this.  The body is being told to create antibodies ahead of an actual infection so that if an actual infection happens, the body is already 10 steps ahead and knows what to look for and what to do when seen.  Unlike typical vaccines which have to first see the infection, interrogate it as it spreads, learn from it, and then provide itself instructions how to combat it.  mRNA takes most of those steps out and keeps you ahead of the infection.

So what long term damage would you expect to see exactly?  Your body is being told told to do one specific thing and one thing only (in this particular instance, watch for Covid then take action immediately).  If you never see the threat, the cells never create the antibodies.  So tell us what long term damage you can possibly expect to see with a vaccine instruction that is potentially never called upon?

If you want to discuss long term effects of a vaccine, I'd be far more concerned with being injected with traditional vaccines which use watered down live loads.  The mRNA doesn't do that - it doesn't give you Covid and then relies on your body to make antibodies.  It only gives your body the instructions on what to do should Covid be seen.  Think of it like a cheat code.  Your body knows what to do before anything actually happens.";BigDaddyJinx;2;0

Some countries have very low mortality of 0.5% and some have as high as 10%.  So they used 2% as the figure for illustration.  2% being a quite common number for mortality in several countries.  They could've used the median number which would've been roughly 5%, but then when they used that 5% figure of the 7.7 Billion population, the number of dead in that scenario would be vastly higher (thanks to how math works) and people would be freaking the fcuk out.

The tail of the mRNA slowly gets broken down by enzymes within the cell. Once the tail is gone, the mRNA becomes unstable and degrades. mRNA is a simple structure. It cannot enter the nucleus of the cell and it cannot do anything to change DNA. mRNA only has one job and that is to relay it's message to create a protein within the cell's cytoplasm.

As for deaths following the vaccine, The Astrazeneca vaccine has caused deaths because it can cause blood clots. This vaccine is a different type of vaccine that uses parts of the virus itself. I wouldn't recommend the Astrazeneca vaccine because of the deaths associated with it. 
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have also been associated with deaths, however it's a little bit different. These vaccines generate a small immune response. That's why some people report feeling sick after receiving one of these vaccines. Even though your body isn't actually being attacked by a virus, your body still thinks it is because of the ""spikes"", so you might get a fever as your body increases its temperature to help fight off these foreign ""spikes"". The deaths following these vaccines typically occur in care homes for the elderly, because some of these people a very vulnerable. The stress of producing a small immune response is enough to contribute to their death. If you are extremely sick, I would advise you don't get the vaccine and stay at home, because if the symptoms associated with the vaccine could kill you, then the actual virus will certainly kill you. It is important for the healthy population to receive the vaccine to stop spreading the virus and eradicate it so that those who could die from the immune generated symptoms of the vaccine don't have to get the vaccine.";The Painted Cynic;0;

UgwTGlmi52QRQP_JIhB4AaABAg.9LUd1EPWAlK9NbpiaDzKSn;2021-05-21T18:51:46Z;"@The Painted Cynic   Yes, natural mRNA is unstable and breaks down easily , but are you aware that the mRNA in the vaccines is synthetic?    How long does that take to disperse?    And the spike proteins that it tricks the cells into making are not natural either. You won't find free floating spike proteins anywhere in nature and we've just turned our bodies into manufacturers of literally millions of these things.
If the immune response which they provoke doesn't destroy them all, where will they lodge in our bodies?  The serious inflammation/clots  caused by this will be  just one of the problems which these vaccines pose. 

It is not important that the population gets vaccinated. It has a 99.8% recovery rate , no more serious than a bad flu , and is only dangerous to the frail elderly and others with serious health issues.  As happens every year with the flu.  '

Asymptomatic spread is a concept they just made up last year. Have you heard it used before? Asymptomatic means healthy.  The vaccine  does not prevent you from being inflected or from spreading the virus.  It MAY lessen your symptoms. 

Despite what the MSM tell you , there were very few excess deaths last year in the world.  The normal flu,  pneumonia, heart attacks, cancer etc were all rebranded as virus deaths to continue the fear.

We have all been lied to by the govts/media. There was no pandemic - the case numbers were hugely inflated by the use of the now completely discredited PCR test. It is a brilliant device but it is not a diagnostic tool.   You won't hear about that if you only watch MSM.  The payments to hospitals for each case and death meant the numbers of deaths were also inflated. 

What did you see with your own eyes in your street , your community, your workplace, which convinced you that there was a devastating sickness around?  Most people don't even know anyone who was sick. In a real pandemic half the people you know would be dead. Society would have broken down completely. Lockdowns and stupid masks would have made no difference at all.

So you have to ask yourself why would they deliberately scare tens of millions of people into thinking they were virus positive, terrify the world into thinking a deadly virus was all around us, waiting to pounce?  The globalists running this scam have an agenda .  The vaccine = vaccine passport = Digital ID = total control by our ''leaders''.   Just like China's Social Credit Score which they've had in place for a decade. Its horrifying.";L S;0;

UgwT9bXc_Y3IcESDOzV4AaABAg;2021-05-21T22:16:59Z;This video is INCREDIBLY INACCURATE.  First, relational databases can scale EXACTLY the same way horizontally across multiple servers as described here if you need that.  Seriously, exactly the same.  But you very rarely see that feature used because well designed relational databases are actually very efficient and rarely ever need multiple servers (except maybe for backup/redundancy).  In fact, businesses usually host many separate relational databases on one server because those databases don't need anywhere near the capabilities of a full server.  In the real world relational databases are as good as everything NoSQL databases can do and vastly better in a lot of ways that NoSQL totally sucks at.  Most business data is by nature relational and thus RDBMS systems are vastly better for almost all normal use cases.  The only time something like NoSQL is actually better is if the data to be stored is not structured.  Which is actually fairly rare.  But good RDBMS like Postgres are excellent at storing relational data AND can actually have individual tables that are NoSQL for the rare cases where you really do need that.  So Postgres can do everything NoSQL can, but NoSQL can't do a lot RDBMS can.  The very critical thing this video does not mention is that for effective, performant NoSQL you must understand ALL THE USE CASES of the data ahead of time and design the data to be stored in NoSQL accordingly.  If you do not then NoSQL is incredibly slow and does not scale.  This is clearly documented in AWS DynamoDB for example.  In practice this means if you design & build a system for certain purposes, and then need to add additional functionality later that could either destroy the performance/scalability or you may have to completely redesign all the data and rewrite much of the code.  A reasonably well designed relational database does not suffer from these problems, if the tables are designed according to the natural (easy to figure out) relationships between the data you can then use that database for pretty much any purpose and get good performance.  This is an incredibly important difference.  NoSQL can be very useful for certain (fairly rare) use cases, but even then usually only part of the data is unstructured and other parts of the data is naturally relational.  The real reason I see most frequently why NoSQL is becoming popular is due to lazy developers who don't know SQL and don't want to bother learning how to design a relational database properly.  NoSQL is most frequently used poorly as an excuse not to do data design up front by developers who don't like working with databases, but as mentioned up-front data design is actually far more important to scale NoSQL which is why a lot of important projects that need long-term support end up being rewritten from NoSQL to RDBMS later on.;Me Myself I;1;0

Needing to obtain and manage multiple servers is far more of a headache than configuring an RDBMS to do this.  This is considered difficult for RDBMS because its almost never necessary.  RDBMS are so damn fast and performant (if you bother to design your tables & indexes decently) that you almost never need multiple servers.  In fact, the vast majority of relational databases in companies are hosted on shared RDBMS servers that host the databases of many different applications simultaneously - without performance issues.  Plus this video glosses over the major data inaccuracy point - that even after you've successfully inserted into a NoSQL system doing a query for that data may return nothing for awhile until all the servers have been able to replicate/sync.  Which ALSO means that if you later update that data in a NoSQL any processes that fetch that record may get the new or the old copy (depending on how far replication has gotten) and there is no way for the application to know if it has current or stale data.  THAT IS HUGE and a potentially massive problem.;Me Myself I;0;

Various database systems (RDBMS and NoSQL) are actually capable of understanding JSON and allowing queries that use data in the JSON.  So you can run a query that returns all the JSONs that contain orders above $100.  BUT - and this is a big but - having the database server parse though that JSON is slow, vastly slower than performing the same query on an RDBMS that contains the order total in an indexed column.;Me Myself I;0;

How many databases exist in the world that index that many totally unrelated things?  Um Google, Bing, Facebook.  Situations like that represent probably 0.001% (or less) of all databases in existence.  The vast majority of software developers work for companies and the vast majority of corporate data is naturally relational.

White blood cells eat all sorts of crap that enters our body. The ""spike"" proteins wont get ""lodged"" anywhere in our bodies. These proteins are essentially the ID card of the virus and anywhere these proteins go they will be identified by cells in our body. Once the body recognizes the ""spike"" protein as an intruder, all the ""spike"" proteins will be destroyed very quickly. 
I'm not sure where you got the idea of proteins clotting(?) but that doesn't happen. The worst thing that could happen with a vaccine like this would be if it triggered a cytokine storm, but with the amount of testing that's already been done on it, that's not even an option right now. 
Asymptomatic spread is not a new term, you've just never heard it before. The vaccine does stop the spread of viruses. How do you think we've nearly eradicated measles, small pox, and polio?
I'm not sure how to argue with you about whether or not covid is real and deadly, because to me it's a fact. Just because it doesn't have a 50% death rate doesn't mean it's not a pandemic. Medical care has come a long way since 100 years ago so this pandemic is obviously not as devastating as previous pandemics because we can at least treat some patients. Without the extensive lockdowns, we would have seen a lot more deaths as hospitals filled up and could no longer treat people. You believe the news sources when they speak of deaths from the vaccine, but you don't believe them when they speak of deaths from the virus. You obviously only see and believe what you WANT to see and believe.
As a student nurse, I've literally seen with my own eyes people who could have easily lived another 20-30 years suffocate to death alone in a hospital bed from this virus. I've heard from my colleagues of countless patients who never left the hospital alive from this virus. I honestly don't even know how I can continue on after this. How can I help sick people when they choose holistic or home remedies because they don't believe in medicine and then they die because I couldn't help them?

To turn those who are vaccinated against those who aren't.

As a student nurse , you would be aware that the vascular nature of this particular virus , meant that HCQ and Ivermectin were having astounding success in early treatment of this illness . Those drugs were banned and smeared across the world because  Bill Gates and the rest of the globalist monsters couldn't get their vaccines authorised if treatment already existed. Doctors in some countries were even threatened with jail if they prescribed it. Those people have blood on their hands.

I'm not saying people didn't die from covid, only that the case numbers were vastly overstated via the PCR test  and illnesses were rebranded to reflect a covid death. I don't where you have the idea that there has been enormous amounts of testing done on these vaccines.  They have tried to get them to work for decades but couldn't, because the animals trials always failed. Only a couple of months  last year doesn't make for exhaustive testing. There has never been a successful mRNA vaccine from any drug company and Moderna has never brought a vaccine to market before.  

Don't you find it disturbing that Pfizer's trials last year specifically excluded pregnant women or men who had sexual partners of child bearing age , but now they're yeah it's all okay. Everyone just step right up and get jabbed. Even children ,and you know that they have a 99.998% chance of dying from this thing.

Arduino IDE use? Well very much in theory, If you like compile-and-upload times of several minutes (so you must LOVE coffee!) go ahead.

UgxsXh_gqyVwIi2wrPF4AaABAg;2021-05-22T20:48:13Z;"Great artistic videos you have here Mr. SE.

However, what led you to believe proof of stake was first exposed in 2011?  It's incorrect.

Satoshi introduced his own version of PoS in the later versions of the bc white paper.  They all had version numbers up to v11.  And more than 8 citations.  Satoshi intended the first implementation of Bitcoin to have a combined PoW + PoS algorithm.  However the guy that hijacked bc with the overwritten v0.1.x version number releases only had a very early version of the white paper that only mentioned PoW, which was commonly used on several prior digital currencies.

Notice the various email/mailing list subject lines always mention two digit version numbers but the text in the body of the messages and in the file names have 3 digits.  You think a precise computer programmer and speaker like Satoshi would be loosey-goosey with his numeric designators? And no one would ever mention the discrepancy one time in 12 years?  No.  Because there wasn't a version mismatch, because that was produced after the fact by the person Satoshi subcontracted to modernize and manage the codebase between Jan, 2009 and late 2010 when original Satoshi changed all his account passwords and dipped out .. because he came to realize that Satoshi #2 could not be trusted.

Satoshi #2 also conspired somehow to remove the .PDF contract with their real names that Satoshi inserted into that first week's transactions.

That explains the 2 zero difficulty size anomaly.  And what I've seen mysteriously change in just the past two weeks:. The genesis block always had a hash of all zeros.  And block #1 had a height of like 216 blocks.  (I think).  

Anyways, I'll bet you that if you calculate the number of blocks that would/should be generated during that missing first week, it would exactly account for the two digit difficulty anomaly.  If there was 2-3 computers mining from Jan 1st or 3rd to the 9th.

If memory serves, the actual genesis block was mined on Jan 1st and had 4 newspaper headlines.  The Jan 3rd block had one headline, and also a binary blob of data that consisted of an encrypted business contract specifying the arrangement between real Satoshi and his fake friend Satoshi #2, with their real names.

I believe that Satoshi had asked Satoshi#2 to implement Bitcoin originally using a perfect requirements/specification doc, but he ""couldn't figure it out"" and gave up.  That week Satoshi #1 said to his GF (Satoshi #3), ""How hard could it be?""

And SN#1 sat down and coded bitcoin-v0.1.exe in 4 days.  That would have been over 1.5 years before Jan 2009. 

All will be revealed. Satoshi #1 has compassion and understanding for the bad guys (friends?), and hopes they don't get in trouble.  They know not the error of their ways, and merely forgot that Satoshi#1 always acts to further the best interests of all parties involved.  By being greedy, they lost everything.  By giving everything away, SN#1 manifested everything for everybody forever.

Very ironic.

As Schrodinger's Douchebag points out, the deaths are only part of the problem. Reducing the number of cases will reduce the number of deaths and hopefully prevent potential long-term complications. 
People live different lifestyles and in different environments. While we are all susceptible to this disease, the risks are somewhat different for everybody.

Ugz9anlTIKb9M9S3IOh4AaABAg;2021-05-24T18:30:44Z;"You make a big deal about how mining pools are a problem in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, because of how they cause centralization of power. But does proof-of-stake actually solve this problem?

The reason mining pools exist in proof-of-work systems, is that the chance of a solo miner mining a block is tiny. You could run a farm for months and not get a single block. Or you could get lucky. The mining pool turns a lottery into a steady income by aggregating large amount of computing power, and paying out shares of the income of the blocks you mine together.

I don't see any reason the same couldn't happen in a proof-of-stake system, except where many stakeholders come together to pool their stakes, and turn that into a steady income. Similar to investing in a business that pays dividends.

My conclusion is that proof-of-stake by itself doesn't seem to prevent pooling, and in fact, the same incentives seem to be there as with proof-of-work based currencies. Unless I'm missing something?";pv2b;0;0

Particularly in reporting, master/detail is a very common style of report.

The idea is that you have a master record (commonly a cursor over multiple actually) and that master record can have one or more detail records.  Like an invoice that has multiple line items.

What I'm hearing from this is;

That since the spike proteins built from RNA of the virus, which We have found from the mRNA of the Virus injected and taken up by the target cells (particularly our Lungs), are then produced by our own living cells using their OWN resources to produce spikes from mRNA of the vaccine, to tell other cells to protect Themselves.  The cells (particularly our LUNGS, Mouth, and Throat) might produce a reaction, perhaps...similar to influenza?

We are being told, vaccines are essentially boosting Nature in the field of immunization of the Virus that already occurred, which might have spread faster than catching up to it, am I correct in saying...

UgwEWkab0TdFC52KpOh4AaABAg;2021-05-26T16:55:51Z;How do you determine fraudulent transactions, when you only have one validator responsible for checking? There would have to be others also checking to ensure the validator wasn't passing a fraudulent transaction. And depending on how many steps you have in validating the validators work, you could be spending a lot of energy there too. Maybe the solution would be to randomly select one high stake and one low stake validator for each block. It would drastically reduce the odds of a fraudulent transaction passing, because if the two validators returned different answers you know one of them is wrong and no reward is distributed at that time. At that point it would probably trigger a backup pair of one high one low stake validator, and if both of them get the same answer and it matches one of the original validators, then the original validator who had the right answer can get their reward, the one who returned a wrong answer gets a penalty, and the two backups split the reward and penalty from the one who had a wrong answer (so probably less than being a first-round validator who got it right, but still enough to make it worthwhile). And if the backup validators don't agree on the answer, or they agree but it doesn't match either of the originals, then it's likely a fraudulent transaction that should be stopped. This system wouldn't be as efficient as a single validator per calculation system, but would be a lot more efficient than proof-of-work, it would be a lot more secure and reliable than single validator, and it would also give lower stake individuals the ability to be involved and earn rewards too. And having one high stake plus one low stake involved in every transaction, it can work a bit like a system of checks and balances;Michael;0;0
UgwT9bXc_Y3IcESDOzV4AaABAg.9NcCCffx7ko9Nonaa2H-Zs;2021-05-26T19:43:19Z;@rlui123 NoSQL would be a terrible choice for streaming very large media files.  That is massively inefficient in regards to RAM, I/O , etc.  You want those kinds of files stored on disk.  Period.  Disk allows for efficient random access in blocks which is what you want for an efficient streaming implementation.  Building a streaming system that pulled from NoSQL would have crippling limitations and horrible scalability.  But once again SQL is vastly better for this than NoSQL as well, because some RDBMS (such as Microsoft SQL Server) can actually be configured to store all the blobs for certain tables as disk files, allowing direct access to the data via normal file I/O.  I probably would still not use this unless there was a reasonably small number of total media files (maybe a few thousand max).;Me Myself I;1;0

I've written pure machine code, assembly language and coded for hardware directly - that is bare metal.  What do you mean it provides ""links to ... media files""?  So it doesn't store the large, multi-gigabyte media file itself but instead stores a URL or whatever reference to a file stored elsewhere?  Is that what you're saying?  If so, then this invalidates what you said in your prior message when you were talking about NoSQL storing multi-gigabyte files.  If the files aren't being stored in the database then the size of the files is utterly meaningless and you put emphasis on big file sizes.  Also, a SQL RDBMS can store ""links"" to files (URLs or whatever) just as well and maybe even better than a NoSQL database.  That's very unlikely to be a good use case for NoSQL.";Me Myself I;1;0

It checks that a payment initiator has a high enough balance to make the payment. It also checks if the initiator is the rightful owner of the wallet (basically check the signature on the transaction). If those check out, the transaction is finalized and stored on the blockchain. There's no fancy algorithm to try and detect fraud (like what regular banks try to do). A blockchain only cares about if you're the owner of a wallet and if it has sufficient funds to make the transaction. Trying to game the system will result in a penalty (depending on the consensus algorithm used);Simply Explained;0;0

2) every flu season (average 3 times a year) the several adenovirus‚Äô population in any geographical area undergo a process called GENETIC SHIFT and GENETIC DRIFT which is responsible for creating variants like H1N1, H7N1 etc. You can find videos explaining genetic shift and genetic drift in common flu adnenoviruses.
In a nutshell, the genome of the virus CROSS HYBRIDIZES (not mutate) with other variants atleast 3 times a year. This does not mean that it becomes more deadly.

Imagine 3 different kinds of puzzles and they all have 100 pieces each, but you can fit 1 piece from puzzle 1 into puzzle 3, and 15 pieces of puzzle 2 into puzzle 3. The final complete pictures of the puzzles will look ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù but the pieces will fit perfectly, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with adenoviral genomes.

I don't get very well why just adding the nonce to the sha256 function adds the same amount of 0s that has being set in the difficulty property.  Is just that the mineBlock function creates hashes until it finds one with the amount of 0 set in difficulty? But int this case there is still a chance to fin the hash in the first iteration.

Some questions I note:
1. Does hashing power in the PoW model mean more security layers?
2. PoS is less immutable given that its coding for verification is less layered (above), it seems, somehow. Given the simple energy comparison, it is difficult for me to believe PoS is better than PoW unless I learn much more about it. Any mechanism of punishment in the PoS model means a rejection of data. It is not a good indicator, even though I don't know Inter-planetary file systems enough to draw a conclusion from PoS deployed in IPFS. The punishment model simply indicates deliberate right or wrong, or simplification. It does not lower the incentive, instead or increase it - it directly punishes. How far is this true?
2.5. The theory for punishment, timeless or updateless, or proactive, whatever the name, seems to be flawed.

In PoW, you have to do tons of hashes on the same block again and again only modifying its nonce until the hash result matches a specific contract. It requires a lot of tries to find a valid nonce and these tries take time and energy.
In case of PoS as explained above, you would only have to hash once per validator to determine the next validator. Easy task, even if there are many validators. No competition, no need for gigantic mining farms.

To do a 51% attack on bitcoin you need half of the hashing computing power (that means only the 4 biggest bitcoin mining pools). To do a 51% on a PoS currency, you typically need 51% of the coins. Some people think that if you own 51% of a currency, you won't attack it because the currency will lose its value and you will lose all your investments. So PoS should be a lot less targeted by 51% attacks.";rt1517;1;

UgypFSMQLIwWp5gF0sV4AaABAg.9M5ri0Bmco39O5G65RqL5C;2021-06-02T14:28:15Z;That is actually not true. The difference between a pyramid scheme and proof of stake, is that in a pyramid scheme you get paid if more people buy into the scheme. In contrast, proof of stake rewards stake pools for their work (validating transactions). If they do a bad job or try to do something malisious their stake gets cut. So they are incentiviced to do a good job. The whole thing takes another form, when delegators are brought into the table. I actually made a video about this if you are interested :);Meet Crypto!;0;

I'm currently leaning on PoW. So, feasibility-wise you mean PoS is less secure, but in terms of the desire to take the 51% attack potential, PoW has a higher competition. (excluding less popular PoW coins not targeted as Store of Value) Based on your explanation concerning the need for gigantic mining farms so far, it has a higher energy demand for attacks than PoS.";Harish Kumar Gujudhur;0;

Yes performing a 51% attack on bitcoin would be very difficult as you need a lot of power. But it would be not as hard as owning 51% of the Bitcoins which would cost something like 250,000,000,000$. And if you have 250,000,000,000$ of bitcoins, I bet you will not attack the currency... For smaller currencies, using the cloud or a botnet may allow you to perform a 51% attack without spending that much money. While if you have 51% of some small currency, stealing the other 49% is not as much interesting.;rt1517;1;

There are so many reports that the cdc said they just aren't going to update the vaers system anymore. I tried pulling data from the vaers system but I can't get the results down under 10,000 to see the results. There have been 174 million positive cases and 89% have survived. Only 0.047% of the world's population has passed from the virus, and that number includes gunshot deaths labeled as covid, car accidents labeled as covid, drug overdoses/suicides labeled covid so it's probably about half of that number. Also, if you have had covid, you have antibodies and do not need a vaccine. People who got bird flu still have antibodies from that so it is likely you will have the antibodies for the rest of your life. 18 - 55 year olds that are healthy will be OK, 18 and under are almost immune showing little to no symptoms. But the TV told you you needed it so take it and hope for the best. At least in 3 to 5 years we will know the side affects....besides complete organ failure seen in an alarming number of the labrats;Dilly Dilly;1;0

IT IS NOT A ""VACCINE"" IT IS AN ""ANTIDOTE""!!!!!!!!!

Depending of WHAT them other bastards cooked up in that lab in China and released, the ANTIDOTE might be necessary BUT a very thorough, impartial, open investigation is needed FIRST.

This ENTIRE covid scam could be a CONTROLLED PANDEMIC (like the ‚Äúcontrolled opposition‚Äù) to scare people into taking the ""vaccine"" FIRST (actually ANTIDOTE, NOT VACCINE). THEN, ‚ÄúCONVINCE‚Äù the people THROUGH MORE FEAR TACTICS they need a STEADY, CONSTANT SUPPLY OF THE ANTIDOTE BECAUSE OF THE ""MUTATIONS"", real or not but spread it is real. 

Military labs make BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS and they make ANTIDOTES for them. Military biological labs DON'T MAKE VACCINES BUT ANTIDOTES FOR WHAT THEY ARTIFICIALLY MADE! ‚ÄúVACCINES‚Äù AND ‚ÄúANTIDOTES‚Äù ARE NOT THE SAME! THE MALICIOUS, FULL OF HARM ENTITIES TO MANKIND BLATANTLY USE MISNOMER IN THEIR SPEECHES!

THE ANTIDOTE FOR COVID19 WAS ALREADY MADE, WHEN THEY RELEASED COVID19 BUT THEY HAD TO MAINTAIN THE CHARADE THAT THEY WERE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO GET A VACCINE FOR IT. 

LO BEHOLD, THESE BASTARD, DANGEREOUS TO MANKIND ENTITIES DIDN'T COME UP WITH ONE ""VACCINE"", THEY MADE SIX OF THEM IN LESS THAN A YEAR! A TOTAL IMPOSSIBILITY! ANY VIROLOGIST WILL TELL YOU TO MAKE A VACCINE IT REQUIRES 10-20 YEARS! 

ANTIDOTES ARE EASY TO MAKE, COMPARED TO VACCINES, BECAUSE YOU MAKE THE ANTIDOTE FOR WHAT YOU ALREADY MADE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MADE, YOU KNOW THE INGREDIENTS IN IT AND YOU MAKE THE OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH NEUTRALIZES WHAT YOU MADE ALREADY IN THE FIRST PLACE, WHICH IS THE ARTIFICIAL, MANUFACTURED, MAN MADE BIOLOGICAL WEAPON. IN THIS CASE COVID19, WHICH IS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON, FOR THE PURPOSE TO MAKE STEADY FLOW OF MONEY FOR THEM, THROUGH THEIR ANTIDOTES THEY CALL ‚ÄúVACCINES‚Äù. A LOT BETTER MONEY MAKER THAN THE ""ILLEGAL"" DRUG BUSINESS! THIS IS THE ""LEGAL"" DRUG BUSINESS IN ACTION! LATER ON, THEY SIMPLY REPLACE THE ANTIDOTES WITH SALINE SOLUTION IN ORDER TO RAKE IN MORE MONEY FOR THEMSELVES. THESE ENTITIES ARE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING! ANYTHING!

Their annual ""flu shots"" didn't bring them enough mullah, so they had to invent a more profitable enterprise and they had a ""winner"" with this covid19...until now.

WHO GAINS THE MOST AND WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?

My main concern is not knowing the long-term side effects of this new so-called vaccine...I'm not volunteering to be a test subject to find out.  Most vaccines have undergone 5-10 year long studies to determine that.  What's telling is that around 50% of medical professionals are declining the vaccine. I've decided to focus on treatment (like Ivermectin) in case of infection.  At the end of the day there are potential risks for either decision that we must live with.;a Way farer;0;0

People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. BTC price fall means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by tradling. I'm still an investor but still I'm winning by applying the same method in every trad e, you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears), which is tradlng.

UgyA7w_L_XaIjjlhmsR4AaABAg;2021-06-08T16:52:40Z;"They are digital deeds. They are worthless unless backed up with some sort of right, such as the copyright. It's like owning a home, minus being able to live in it. NFTs are a great way to sign a document and the technology will be useful, however owning for the sake of owning is not going to pan out economically. With physical works of art, the owner keeps the rare original and shows it at galleries, or lends it to other galleries, and there is the risk of loss. The speculation end of the economic value of the painting can be extended centuries. If Mona Lisa existed as a digital work of art, there would be none of that. People would not fly to Paris to see it in person. They'd google it. That dilutes the value of even the most premium works of art ever made.
As a technology, NFTs will be very useful. But they don't magically make something worth millions any more than your house is worth millions simply because the deed is written on really super-duper cryptographically secure and good paper. If a copyright came with an NFT, then you'd have something to give it value. Otherwise you could just as well sell NFTs on the word ""the"" and become a trillionaire.";Ryan McGowan;11;0

And moreover, there's absolutely cases where spending millions with an underlying NFT makes perfect sense. For instance corporate shares based on NFTs would make a lot of sense. However, anyone could have written a legal contract before NFTs. The thinking that because it's cryptographically secure doesn't make NFTs worth millions. The question is, is a **meme** worth millions? Is it worth millions without copyrights or reproduction rights attached to it? NFTs are a tool to secure data, not where the value actually is. No one looks at the deed to a house as the thing that contains value. It's the house that has value. A deed to a house that burned to the ground is still a valid deed, and NFTs are the same. They aren't the thing you ""invest"" in. The deed and an NFT just assigns it to someone. If you're going to invest in speculation on ""NFTs"" you're really not getting what they are. It's like saying ""I'm going to invest millions on a legal contract!"" So set aside for the moment the fact that NFTs exist, and instead write a legally-binding contract to sell a meme from person A to person B, and include in it a clause that it is excepting therefrom all copyrights and reproduction rights, and record it with a court or office of records. What would that contract be worth? If that changes the economic equation in your head, it shouldn't. It's absolutely 100% identical. The change from a recorded document to an NFT is not a massive change from before. But I suspect people see the word crypto and think it's the next Bitcoin. It is not. NFTs and Bitcoin are totally different things. As time goes on, people will understand what they are (and aren't) and things like memes will find a fair market value, and market values go up, and down as well. Meme's ownership secured by NFTs have all the characteristics of a future value less than present. If there's an argument to be made, it's why a meme is valuable to own. NFTs are not a reason.";Ryan McGowan;0;0

One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead.

If an NFT is created from the ticket when you buy it, it can record your identity information on the ticket immutuably, to prevent black market selling. Though I don't know if such things are already done with tickets anyway to prevent black market sales.;yorick;0;0

If an NFT is created from the ticket when you buy it, it can record your identity information on the ticket immutuably, to prevent black market selling. Though I don't know if such things are already done with tickets anyway to prevent black market sales.;yorick;0;
