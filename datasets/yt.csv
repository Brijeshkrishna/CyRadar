"Hey @Savjee, thank you for this video it helps me a loth! I'm just wondering is it possible to make some command for Push on the server? For example, i don't want that bitbucket push files on the FTP server every time that i commit. So is it possible to make something like commitName[command for push] and that command to be trigger for pushing?",0
"I think your question is: how can I push to FTP when I want it (on certain commit). The answers is: use branches. Create a branch ""dev"" and commit as many times as you want in it. Then once you're finished, you can merge your dev branch into the master branch to let BitBucket deploy it.  Check out the documentation: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/configure-bitbucket-pipelines-yml-792298910.html and read the section ""Mapping your branch workflow in bitbucket-pipelines.yml"". There they show you how you can run BitBucket Pipelines only for certain branches. So may choose to only use Pipelines on your master branch, not on your dev branch.  I think that will help you ;)",0
"Yep, exacly what i was searching for :) Thank you again, cheers",0
"Great material! Thank you !. When I'm trying to run build manually, i'm getting an error: stderr: Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository.  Do you have a video how to setup Bitbucket and Jenkins with SSH?",0
"That's probably because you're using a private repository. You need to generate a new SSH key pair, configure Jenkins to use these keys and add these keys to your BitBucket account.  I'll think about creating a video about it, but not right now. I'm working on a new video series.",0
Nice! Are you going to do a video pipeline build for Java?,0
+Kasper Sørensen I don't actively use Java so a video for it isn't planned. I will add it to my ideas list though! Thanks for the suggestion.,0
"+Savjee Okay :-) I can't seem to figure it out, that was my reason for asking.",0
your css is not working man,0
"Thanks for letting me know! Someone else also pointed this out. Stupid mistake of me!  It's because I uploaded the file with the extension "".Css"" (note the uppercase C). On OS X you have a case insensitive file system which means that .Css is the same as .css. On S3 however those are two different files. So renaming the file fixes this issue ;)",0
"Great video:  i have followed same steps from the video and configured job but gives me error when i insert bitbucket . Error ""Failed to connect to repository : Command ""/usr/bin/git -c core.askpass=true ls-remote -h https://samsonawane@bitbucket.org/samsonawane/web.git HEAD"" returned status code 128: stdout: stderr: fatal: Authentication failed""   could you please suggest any solution on this",0
"+Samadhan Sonawane Jenkins already helps you out and says ""Authentication fails"". You're probably using a private repository and for that you need to add SSH keys to Jenkins. (See the credentials section)",0
"thanks for prompt reply. could you please suggest any reference link for ""how to add SSH key for bitbucket in jenkins"".  i am new to this.",0
"Sure! Start by generating a new SSH private and public key. Look around on the internet, you'll definitely find some tutorials on this. Then, in Jenkins, go to your project and find the section ""Source Code Management"". There you find the url to git repository. Under the URL you'll also find ""Credentials"". Click on the add button and add a ""SSH Username with private key"". You can choose a random username and then paste your private key into the ""Private Key"" field. Save the settings in Jenkins.  Now go to the settings of your BitBucket project and go to ""Deployment keys"". Click ""Add key"", give it any label and paste your public key into the field. Now everything should be working!",0
Great set of tutorials. In a future video will it be possible for you to show us on how to protect Lambda functions and also the API methods (from API Gateway) ?  It would also be nice If you could do a series on Amazon Cognito and Amazon Dynamo DB,0
"This series is still a work in progress and I will do a video on custom authorizers in the future! So hang on, I'm making them in my free time, as fast as I can ;)",0
Is actually free for the first year,0
Great Tutorial!! Thank you!   Can this solution use SFTP? I always like to send files via secure connection if possible...,0
"Yes it is possible but then you have to use the ""Plublish over SSH"" plugin: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Publish+Over+SSH+Plugin",0
Many thanks... I'll have a look...   I'm never one to make things easy for myself!!! :P,0
I love your videos! Keep up the good work!,0
Thanks a lot! Let me know if you have suggestions ;),0
"+Savjee I always wanted to build a complete application with all amazon services! If you keep doing videos about integrating amazon services with each other I will be happy! Like how to make an app that works with lambda, api gateway, cognito, sqs, cloudfront, simpledb, etc",0
That is definitely coming! Keep an eye open for future video's ;),0
great thanks!,0
Thanks for these! Much simpler than the docs 😜 !,0
Really a great tutorial. Successfully done also add after build step to deploy it on EC2  using Code Deploy. Thanks lot @Savjee,0
Hi Thierry! I've been uploading new video's  this week about integrating Lambda with DynamoDB. Thought you might be interested ;) Check out the rest of the series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiSQMe68cti8cupI0mzLk1Gc,0
Yeah I watched it this morning at 7h AM haha! ;) Thank again!,0
I'd like to know how to deploy static website to Google Cloud Strage with Bitbucket Pipelines.,0
"I don't have any experience with Google Cloud Storage, but if I look at the documentation it's certainly possible.  Take a look here: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website Apparently you can use gsutil to upload files from the command line. So you can create a Pipelines configuration where you install the gsutils and run the required commands.",0
Thank you for your reply.,0
"Hello  I'm new to this part of lambda, but I would like to see as upload files to S3 through lambda, are very good your videos :)",0
These Lambda videos are great! Keep it up!,0
I will do a video on this in the future! Thanks for the suggestion.,0
great video! i've manage to setup and build but failed on bitbucket's webhook.  it says error 404 and cannot find http://MY_URL/bitbucket-hook/ .,0
"A few things that you could check: 1) Make sure that your Jenkins installation is accessible from the internet (in other words: not running on your local network, unless you have port-forwarding set up) 2) Did you include the port number of Jenkins? (usually 8080) 3) Is the URL typed correctly?",0
"@Savjee the jenkins i configured is hosted on google cloud platform as a jenkins-instance. Accessing its home page http://SOME.IP.ADDRESS, is redirected to http://SOME.IP.ADDRESS/jenkins/ so I used http://SOME.IP.ADDRESS/jenkins/bitbucket-hook/ and it works now.  So lesson learned, it looks like that it depends on how you setup your jenkins home page then add the bitbucket-hook/ endpoint.  Thanks a lot for these videos!",0
+Alistair Cerio I'm glad the videos helped you out! Thanks a lot!,0
Hi @Savjee: Let's Said I have a source branch call =feature and traget branch = develop how do I create an event of triggering a build when any feature branch (feature/*) is merged into the develop branch. could you please help me out the pipelines script ?,0
what do you thing about this way of doing : # You can use a Docker image from Docker Hub or your own container # registry for your build environment. image: maven:3.3.9 pipelines:   default:      - step:          script: # Modify the commands below to build your repository.            - mvn --version     branches:     feature/fetigueTest:       - step:           script:             - git merge Test:                - mvn clean install,0
"I saw your other reaction and you're almost there! The thing is, when you merge your feature branch into the develop branch, your actually just creating a commit on the develop branch. So you need to configure Pipelines to only run for the develop branch.",0
So it's going to like that right ? image: maven:3.3.9 pipelines:   default:      - step:          script: # Modify the commands below to build your repository.            - mvn --version     branches:     Develop       - step:           script:             - git merge Test:                   - mvn clean instal,0
image: maven:3.3.9 pipelines:   default:      - step:          script: # Modify the commands below to build your repository.            - mvn --version     branches:     feature/fetigueTest:       - step:           script:             - git merge Develop:                  - mvn clean install,0
Wow this is cool. I want to send email when the pipeline get completed. I wrote a small code but not working.  pipelines:   default:     - step:         script: # Modify the commands below to build your repository.           - apt-get update            - apt-get -qq install git-ftp           - git ftp push --user $FTP_STAGING_USERNAME --passwd $FTP_STAGING_PASSWORD ftp.example.com           - exec php https://www.example.com/mail.php   exec php https://www.example.com/mail.php :- When this page get hits it will send an email to me but not woking. Can u help me ??,0
Yes!,0
"Couple of things that you should fix:  1. ""exec php"" is not a valid terminal command under linux. It is just ""php script_name.php"" 2. You cannot execute a PHP script that is on a remote server. You have to download it first! You can use CURL or Wget for that, so make sure that you install them in the container that BitBucket pipelines creates. 3. PHP is by default not installed in the debian container, so you also have to install that (or find another template)",0
Didn't knew we can use CURL in git. Thanks to you i have successfully integrated mail using pipeline. thank you.,0
Your previous video seems to be unavailable :(,0
Thanks for letting me know! I fixed the link in the description. You can also check out the entire series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiSaisKr7OnM4Fl7JXCDDcmt,0

That is weird. Make sure that you generated a certificate for the exact same domain name as your website. A certificate for subdomain.yourdomain.com is not valid for www.yourdomain.com or yourdomain.com.  You can also create a wildcard certificate that is valid for your naked domain and all subdomains.,0
"Thank you, Sir. Your explanation is so clear. I have been struggling with Lambda for one month and I think I get nothing from the AWS documentation. Your tutorial series is great! AWS is indebted to you.",0
You are my savior,0
"After being tortured by the docs for 30 days, I lost hope since I thought I could never understand the mechanisms of Lambda manipulating DynamoDB.  But, I understand it by your 10 min's video. You are a great tutor! Thank your Sir, you save my life.",0
Thanks a lot man! If you have any suggestions for future videos: make sure to let me know!,0
Can you reference where in the docs this is documented? Thanks!!,0
Great tutorial! Great tutor!,0
Thank you sir!,0
"Simple and effective, thanks for the video. Especially since most of the other Lamda videos show older versions of the UI.",0
"Thank you for this fantastic tutorial series! The most challenging thing about AWS for me is figuring out how to make the individual services work together to make a complete application, and your tutorial series cleared up a lot of things for me about making API Gateway work with Lambda.",0
"Sir, would you please make a tutorial on AWS Cognito for browser's use? A working example of logging in and out functionality for browsers is missing in the Cognito library. The developers of the Cognito library failed to provide a reasonable workflow of logging in and out. Surprisingly, such a critical functionality is not well explained by the Cognito team.  https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js.",0
"I will put your idea on my todo list and try to do some research about Cognito. Not sure though when I will be able to film it. In the mean time, maybe take a look at custom authorisers. These are Lambda functions that can be used to give a user permissions to API endpoints.",0
"Thanks a lot! The nice thing about AWS is that most of their services are designed to work together. In this series I've only shown how Lambda can be integrated with API Gateway and DynamoDB, but you could integrate it with many other services.",0
Thank you for your quick response. The AWS Cognito Javascript library is struggling with an working example of logging in and logging out. The Cognito library team failed to provide key features of Promise and React support. I think that the incorporation of Cognito with React (a good example is here: https://blog.tighten.co/react-101-building-a-gif-search-engine) is a critical improvement. I would like to offer help if you have a trouble in writing a Redux middleware.,0
Awesome videos!,0
"Hi! I've this when I write in the console ""s3_website cfg apply""  Message: ""Applying the configurations in s3_website.yml on the AWS services ... The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint. (Aws::S3::Errors::PermanentRedirect)""  Do you know why happens this?",0
"Hi, I just operate as your video, but it does not work. not https... I use the www.domain.com so I fill as you said domain.com and *.domain.com",0
"In properties we have to choose ,enable web-hosting option, And need to provide our index & error page name in that so that it will work, which is not mentioned in the video  Please correct me if my understanding is wrong here !!!",0
great more tuts please,0
It is mentioned in the video. See 2:16,0
"Yes, an S3 bucket is always in a specific region. The AWS API always wants you to make calls to the correct region. So you shouldn't access resources in a EU region by going through a US endpoint.  By default s3_website uses one of the US regions endpoints. If your bucket is in another region you have to add that to do s3_website.yml file. For example: my bucket is in the Ireland region (eu-west-1) so my config file contains this line:  s3_endpoint: eu-west-1  Hope that helps ;)",0
please post a video how to send a mail with lambda,0
Great starter video. You may want to revisit the code though. If min=5 and max=10 you will certainly get values above 10...,0
"Thank you very much for your videos! You saved a lot of time for me!   Your voice and how you do it, it's great!  Please, keep it up!",0
Excellent serie of tutorials Savjee.  Looking forward for the next episodes,0
Yes you are right! Feel stupid now! Hah!,0
"i followed the instruction as you have mentioned and it didn't work. after i waited for some minutes and the Distribution Status changed to Deployed,  still not working and i even checked on sslchecker.com",0
You will need to be a bit more specific if you want some help. This technique *does* work as I'm using it for my website www.savjee.be,0

"Thanks, this is a very informational and helpful video. Can you also share a tutorial how you host you application to cloudfront. Thanks in Advance",0
"thanks Savjee.      great demo.   can you add a demo that shows a python script that writes to dynamo table ARN as you have,  but also can be switched to local dynamodb instance for testing.    would like to see how you'd switch the IAM to local resource.",0
Great videos!!! Is there a way we can trigger repeatable email notification  setup when something goes wrong  unless someone acknowledge it?,0
"Sure, you could use Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) to send out email. Just as with DynamoDB you can use its API to integrate with it and send email.",0
"Unfortunately I don't have any experience with Python. However, if you are running the local version of DynamoDB you don't have to worry about IAM. Any request that you make to your local DynamoDB instance will be allowed and you can use fake credentials.",0
But i was looking not one time email trigger. I was looking for multiple email trigger unless someone acknowledge.,0
"I'm not sure I totally understand your question then.. You can perfectly send multiple emails with SES and you build your ""unless someone acknowledge"" condition with node.js. If no acknowledges -> send email. Something like that is definitely possible.",0
hey ! please can you help me with amazonaws ? do you have facebook or twitter ?,0
"Yes I do, but I can help you here in the comments.",0
when i type ./gogs web it says -bash: ./gogs: No such file or directory,0
"i want to create a web on amazonaws , that when i click on it to get another website,,,,like  a redirect ,,,,",0
"I'm not sure what you mean.  ""Clicking on something to go to another website"" is a simple hyperlink (in html: <a href=""""></a>)  If you want to redirect somewhere else, you can either setup a redirect rule in S3 like so: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html or use the HTML meta refresh tag: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H76.html",0
You should run that command inside the directory where you've downloaded gogs. So you should probably change directory.,0
"Hi, you are a very good tutor,  your lambda tutorial series is superb. Keep it up. Now I am looking forward to Amazon Kinesis(both stream and firehose with explanation) tutorials from your side. Thank you!",0
I've tried inside the directory where the initial tar.gz is as well as the gogs folder that was created when I extracted it,0
cool!!,0
"Hi Savjee. I love your FTP pipeline video. At the moment, I use Buddy, but I would like to use Bitbucket's own capabilities. Is your Debian 'image' publicly available? I presume this allows the '.yml' file to understand the script commands?",0
"Thanks for the video!  I was wondering about config ""environment-dependent"" files such as wp-config.php on Wordpress or config/app.php on CakePHP. How would you treat them? I think you should ignore them in .gitignore (obviously), but how could we upload them to server?  The way I see it, maybe we could have a separated folder on our server, let's say: /config_files/ and put the config files there by a different upload process. And our main pipeline could copy the files from this folder to their right place in the project after each deployment. Is there a better (simpler or safer) way?",0
I usually don't commit these config files to the git repository. I upload them once on the server manually. I'm sure there are better ways to do this but I haven't had the time yet to investigate that.,0
Nice video and also the FTP one,0
"Hi,  is it possible to deploy a simple PHP application/website (like Wordpress) using Pipelines and for example Digitalocean? Thank you.",0
"You can use it to deploy almost anything. Pipelines is build around Docker containers. So if your deploy software can run inside a container, you can use Pipelines. I have deployed Laravel applications to FTP servers without problems (using git-ftp). I've also deployed static websites build with Jekyll and deployed with s3_website to AWS. It all works, just requires some time to set it up and test it.",0
How can I run composer install with your solution? And run PHP scripts?,0
"Just add ""composer install"" as an item under ""scripts"".",0
"Hi, Thanks for the tutorial :) . I want to know that I am able to publish the data and see it in real time in AWS IoT. How to get that data from AWS IoT to AWS Lambda ?? I am really confused on this. Can you please help. Thanks :)",0
"I don't have any experience with AWS IoT (yet), but this seems to be what you are looking for: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-lambda-rule.html  It appears that you can configure IoT as a Lambda trigger. Hope it helps!",0
"Awesome video series, especially the FTP. Do you have any expertise in deploying a rails application? And could you explain what exactly happens when using pipelines? As far as I understand, a docker container is a simple and lightweight layer atop of the OS (let's say, it's Ubuntu). So when I run the pipeline somewhere in the deep web a new container gets created for my build. Then, bitbucket pushes all my code into that container. Then it runs all those commands, which I can specify. Is it somewhat correct?",0
"No I don't have any experience with deploying rails applications. But that should not hold you back. The rails community has a lot of build and deployment tools (like Capistrano). There is a lot of stuff written about this. GitHub has a blog post detailing how they handle deployments for example.  The flow of pipelines is indeed how you describe it. BitBucket starts a new container for your build. A container is like a very lightweight virtual machine that isolates everything you do. It doesn't run in ""the deep web"", but simply on one of the Atlassian servers. Also BitBucket does not ""push"" your code into a container. They simply instruct the container to do a git pull.",0
"Awesome, thank you for your response. I am familiar with capistrano, in fact, I wanted to deploy my application using ""cap production deploy"" command from a pipeline script line, but as of now I'm stuck with getting rspec (testing) to work. Anyways, much appreciate your info.",0
I would ditch Sublime Text for Atom. Just saying~!,0
"Great tutorial, a light year better than the official one.",0
Amazing!,0
Great job man! Keep it up!,0
GREAT!,0
Thanks a lot! I will do my best!,0
"Thanks man, that's what I needed!",0
You are good tutorial. I want to know - Is it best practice for putting all of functions into a file or separately ? - If i want to run a schedule function . Lambda + CloudWatch is a best. Do we have another service to do this thing ?  Thanks.,0
"1) Hmm difficult question, there isn't really a best practice for this. Look around on the internet and you'll find success stories about breaking large applications into small functions, but you'll also find stories about how they grouped together functions into bigger functions. Check out this blog post for example: https://blog.cloudsploit.com/we-made-the-whole-company-serverless-5a91c27cd8c4 here they create 1 big Lambda function with multiple controllers in it and put a simple router in front of it.  2) Amazon only offers scheduled Lambda functions through CloudWatch. You could of course also trigger a Lambda function through the AWS API's or you could put API Gateway in front of your function and call that HTTP endpoint through a web service. It's up to you.",0
Thank you so much.,0
Your video is great.  How can we use function with node package ? We have to upload zip file or we are able to use code inline .,0
"If you want to use node packages, you have to upload a zip. You cannot use the online code editor anymore.  You should use a tool to push your code to Lambda. Check out my video about using Apex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7spDymJqmc or you can also user Serverless or one of the many other tools. They allow you to push your entire project (your code + npm packages) to Lambda with just 1 command.",0
"Hi, i have a problem : i create a node function to scrape a site , when i run in local it is good, but when i upload into lambda , it is timeout. I want to know except a reason about my code. Is there any possible reason can happen ?",0
"Hi, I have created the lambda function and created the role as well, but i am not able to invoke the function. When click on Test button it fails with error (Can't find module..). Could you please help me on this.",0
Can you specify which module it can't find?,0
If it's a timeout it's simple: your code does not complete in time and Lambda just kills your process. Try to increase your timeout (can be maximum 300 seconds).,0
That is nothing but my lambda function name only. When i click on 'Test' button it was asking me for the input. What should i need to provide in the input?,0
"so why when i run locally , it only takes 10s to complete, but when i deploy, it takes too long",0
"Hi, I am not able to install apex in my windows machine. Once i download the .exe file and run it, the command prompt window is disappearing. Hence in my prompt ""bash: apex: command not found"" is displaying. Plz help.....",0
That's a different problem then. Maybe AWS cannot resolve the website you are trying to scrape? It definitely sounds like a network issue on AWS side.,0
That depends on your Lambda function. You have to give it some input if your function expects input.,0
Hi excelent tutorial please how to do the similiar deployment in AWS EC2. Hope u could make a tutorial,0
"Your tutorials are great! Any chance you also have one teaching how to create a secure API with ""Open with access key""?",0
"Great series ! Question for you: could you make a video on Lambda's pro & con's? There is so much out there (Azure VM, Google CE) which makes it hard to decide.  Thanks !",0
"I will consider doing a video on that topic. Do you have any questions in particular? What metrics should be compared in your view?  Google Cloud Functions is still in alpha and only support functions written in Javascript. Azure functions seems much more versatile because it supports PHP, C#, Javascript as well as Bash, Powershell and Batch scripts. Azure functions also make it very easy to add a HTTP endpoint to your function, while with Lambda you have to use API Gateway (which is more complicated but also more flexible).",0
"I don't have it right now, but can you explain a bit more what you want? An open API doesn't use access keys, so what do you want specifically?",0
"thanks for video. But now we must configure advanced option to enable GET method. ;D. You have to configure ""Integration Request with type LAMBDA"". Thank a lot for Video.",0
"I don't understand what you mean. If you talk about integrating this Lambda function with a HTTP GET request, watch the next video. It'll detail the steps.",0
"Sorry I'm stupid. I wrong the Video. The message is for part 3.   In the next Video I can't select ""GET"" method, I can only select ""ANY"", I must select advanced option and then to create a new method ""GET"". Sorry. This guide is very well done. Thank you for response.",0
"very useful, thanks man.",0
Thank a lot for the video.,0
"Hi Savjee  I didn't understand where you had your ubuntu server. and I tried to do the same with AWS instance, but Jenkins application was not opening, though I had installed everything you shown in the video series.",0
"I had my Ubuntu server hosted by DigitalOcean (I said that in the introduction). Can you be more specific about ""not opening""? Did you get errors? Is your instance online? Did you use the correct IP address of your instance with the correct port number? ...",0
"When i tried to add triggers to my lamda function the api created is with method ANY by default and there are no options to choose Method type while create the trigger. On clicking the URL it says {message: ""internal server error""}.",0
"""Open with access key"" is the other option besides ""Open"". Basically I'm looking for the proper way to create a secure API that no everybody can access.",0
"I am getting ""Internal server error""  while using api. Can u suggest the solution.",0
Your way of creating API is wrong.  The correct one is to create API through API console.   check out this link  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html,0
My way is not wrong. It's one of multiple ways you link up Lambda with API Gateway.,0
"The first thing I would do is properly configure the CORS headers and only allow traffic from the domains that your are using your API on. This is a very basic security mechanism.  Secondly, you can use API keys to restrict access to your API but you can also write a custom authorizer. Take a look at both of them and decide which one serves you better. With a custom authorizer you can (for example) allow people to login with their Facebook or Google accounts and you can verify their tokens before they can hit any of your resources.  Good luck!",0
"Your videos are great! I'm following this however the lambda function of sending the email doesn't work. Under lambda function monitor I can see that it has been triggered and called, but always return error. I don't know which part caused the problem (since I'm exactly following all the steps) so could you share a GitHub of this apex project that I can check the structure and code? Thanks a lot!",0
Do you recommend creating a dedicated user for the build instead of using one of the developers users? let's say build@mydomain.tld and add that user to Jenkins as well as to BitBucket?,0
"If you are using private repositories, you don't really need dedicated users. Jenkins pulls from your Git repository with an SSH certificate.",0
"Yeah, I realized that, also Created a Team and Jenkins uses ssh key generated in the box and associated with the Team... neat!",0
"Sure, you can find the source for each video on my website: https://savjee.be/videos/aws-lambda-series/using-scheduled-events/",0
Thanks a lot !,0
thanks for your video. I followed the instructions. but the green lock does not appear. do u know what could be the problem?,0
Would be useful to include an explanation for private repos as well,0
Any guide to do it for a .NET project suite with multiple solutions? I'm bit confused on how to convert my build.xml file to project.json :-/,0
Right now I don't have a tutorial for that and also limited knowledge of .NET.  I'll try to see if I can make a video about it.  Maybe you can use Microsoft's own tools? There is Team Foundation Build and Visual Studio Team Services. Hope that helps you somewhat.,0
Savjee thanks a lot :),0

I have also successfully loaded the BitBucket plugin and pointed a Jenkins job to a valid Git repo. The repo is private and remote.,0
"Thank you for putting this great articles together, awesome work and really easy to understand!

"You have to configure the root URL for your Jenkins installation. You can do this in ""Manage Jenkins"" > Configure System > Jenkins URL  Set this to the complete URL of your jenkins installation. Eg: http://YOUR-IP-OR-DOMAIN:8000 or something like that ;)",0
"Thanks for the correction. Someone else also told me about this. Unfortunately I can't fix the video, but the source code on my GitHub was corrected.",0
Hmm sounds like BitBucket is having some issue's with connecting to your Jenkins URL. Is your Jenkins server accessible for anyone on the internet?   Hosting your Jenkins installation at home is not possible for example (unless you get fancy with port forwarding and dynamic DNS),0
"my jenkins URL config its correct http://IP-PUBLIC:8080/  but still not work,",0

Savjee thx for reply. Jenkins is not hosted locally and is available over internet. The only difference between your video demo and my set up is that my repo is private. I believe the problem is with credentials.  Will have to dig around some more with setting up webhook to a private git repo.,0
Thanks a lot Ray for sharing this with us! Will definitely help people out.,0
"Great, let us know when you find the solution. Also: I'm going to add this to my TODO list and make a video about handling private repositories.",0
One question.  There is a chance that bitbucket pipelines will be paid in 2017. Can u do a video with gitlab pipeline to FTP server ??,0
According to Atlassian you will receive 50 build minutes per month for free: https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing/upcoming  I'll definitely consider doing a video series on GitLab and discussing its pipeline feature. However I cannot tell exactly when I'll get that done. You could also host your own Jenkins and use that to deploy to FTP servers.,0
I hope the video comes soon :),0
I'm getting an error message saying that my lambda function isn't authorized to perform writes to the database. How can I authorize it?,0
"Nevermind, I got it. Had to go in to IAM, and give my role DynamoDBFull permissions. :-)",0
"Hey Savjee,  My Question is very simple. I wanna know that is this required to use ""Build Setup"", ""Update"" and ""git Install"" Always, I mean we used it for Init for first time so can we just use ""git ftp push..."" For future pushes ?",0
"Martin Hermosilla question:  for private repo, do you still need ssh key if your Bitbucket is https?  I'm using https not ssh for BitBucket and have everything set up, but when I run a job on Jenkins, the job aborts because of git askpass failure. Wondering if this is because I need to create ssh key on Jenkins and copy key on BitBucket.",0
"if you configure https you need to pass credentials (username+password) not sure 100% if works never tried, in theory should... I use ssh + key because at the end is a connection from a linux server and you give the public key for auth in bitbucket",0
"Can you let me know, how to use cloudwatch for the random generator lambda function that you created in the previous tutorial?",0
"Sure, but can you let me know what you expect from Cloudwatch? What exactly do you want to monitor about this function?",0
"Good question. Sadly it is required everytime. BitBucket Pipelines always creates a new container for each of your builds. When you run for the first time, you have to install git-ftp. But when you run it for a second time, you get a new container and have to reinstall git-ftp again!",0
Oh Ok !! Thanks For Great Information :),0
"Hello I am PHP developer and very new at CI.  Please can you make same series videos or a singe video for Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment with GitLab ?",0

"Also, can you differentiate between cloudwatch vs lambda-canary? (i understand through both we can schedule a lambda function)",0
Well this video shows you exactly how to run any Lambda function on a schedule. What do you want to achieve that wasn't detailed in the video?,0
"I will definitely consider doing that! However, I'm working on expanding the Jenkins series first. But thanks for the suggestion!",0
You are a lifesaver!,0
"My https is still in red. Please help me to find the cause. It says "" (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID). "" and Certificate is issued by www.example.com and issued to www.example.com. Please help me find the cause.",0
Make sure that your domain name matches exactly with the domain name in the certificate. Also note that there is a difference between www.example.com and example.com. You need to add both domains to your certificate.,0
here is the link for the site https://www.puncturemechanic.com,0
My video doesn't use ELB but uses CloudFront. Unfortunately I have no experience with ELB and cannot help you with that. Try setting up CloudFront and make it work that way. It's relatively easy.,0
the domain name is in godaddy and I connected it to AWS using Elastic IP and I changed the records in A Host to the new Elastic IP that was Provided.,0
"Using ELB is kind of overkill. You have only 1 EC2 instance, so you cannot balance load. Again: try setting up CloudFront. First move your EC2 instance to a subdomain, for example: server.mywebsite.com. Then make a new CloudFront distribution that uses that subdomain as origin. Next, point your www.mywebsite.com to the CloudFront distribution. Now you can follow this video and enable the SSL certificate.",0
So shall i delete all the ELB's? And how do i go with routing the domain from godaddy to aws ? shall I continue with Elastic IP ? And shall i delete the old cloudfront ?,0
"""Using ELB is kind of overkill"", so yes I would remove them. Routing domain from GoDaddy to AWS: there are a lot of tutorials for that. It's just creating a new A record in your DNS settings and pointing it to the IP address of your EC2 instance.  You can use the existing CloudFront distribution. Just make sure to change its settings so they match your new setup.",0
Good,0
+Savjee Nice clear explanation. Thanks. Subbed.,0
Thank you for the kind words!,0
"What if I don't want to use CloudFront?  For example, I just want to use EC2 w/o CloudFront.",0

Hey!  Give me one for testing;)   Could you do more tutorials with AWS? :D I'd really love your tutors.  Thank you!,0
I tried sending you the invite through YouTube but I can't send a message to you.  Can you give me your email address or Twitter username or something?   I'll definitely do more tutorials on AWS! Are you looking for anything specific?,0
There are several techniques that you can use to do that. Take a look at this technique (which use crontab): https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-execute-cron-job-after-system-reboot/,0
"I think you should disable the Origin SSL protocols. This setting is useful if your actual server/hosting provider supports SSL. In your case, https://cemates.me doesn't work, so that might be the issue. CloudFront can't access it over SSL.",0

If you don't mind me asking. Why did you choose Apex over Serverless? I'm just getting started with AWS and it's hard to see the differences between the two.,0
"Sure! I can't send you a message on Youtube, so can you give me your email address? Or follow me on Twitter and I'll DM you. Whatever you like ;)",0
I am already following you on twitter. It is @imscreed. Thanks,0
Check your messages and enjoy SetApp until March 2017!,0
Absolutely! Still got 3 left.  I can't message you on YouTube so can you give me your email address? Or follow me on Twitter so I can send you a DM?,0
Apex has less features but is easier to get started with. Serverless has much more features and uses CloudFormation to set up all your functions and permissions.,0
These videos are very good!!!,0
what does the Debian 'image' do exactly and why do i need it?,0
"When you create a new container in Docker you need to specify an image. This image will be used to initialise your container. So with the Debian image, you will get a container in which Debian is installed.",0
"Hi I want to connect the firebase with dynamoDB using trigger? is it possible, if possible then please tell me how ?",0
So do I need to get docker first then? ,0
Does the Cert get installed on your main EC2 instance as well as the cloudfront servers?,0
+Nicholas Dongarra The certificate is only installed on your CloudFront distribution. Not on EC2.,0
"+tony davies (tgrrr) No, Bitbucket Pipelines is based on Docker. They will run containers for you.",0
I guess that would be possible yes. But why would you want to store your data in 2 places? Couldn't you just store it in one of the two?,0
"i want to make the server-less application and as you know about the functionality of firebase,that do the process on real time streaming data and we just explored.",0
+Akhilesh Pandey Then you don't need DynamoDB. You can write to Firebase directly from Lambda functions.,0
"yes sir we are using the AWS lambda function modules, when  we add require modules in firebase. Error are coming firebase modules not find.and then we write same problem AWS forums they tell me other third party solution dear sir-this is my skype id -akhilesh1189,could u connect",0
When you are using node modules (dependencies) you must use a deployment tool like Apex or Serverless. They package up your code with all the dependencies and send it to Lambda.   You check out my video on Apex here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7spDymJqmc&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiSQMe68cti8cupI0mzLk1Gc&index=5,0

"What is the ""some error""? Also watch out with the syntax. After ""nR"" : $input.params('nR'), you have a comma that shouldn't be there since it's the last entry. Also make sure to wrap all your $elem.something in quotes like so: ""$elem.something""",0
"Looks like an issue in your Lambda function. It tells you that list indices must be integers. It means that you can't use ""event['ids']"".  If it's the Lambda ""event"" variable that you are trying to use then you can just use this: ""event.ids""",0

You can deploy multiple files with a tool like Apex or Serverless. See my tutorial on Apex here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7spDymJqmc&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiSQMe68cti8cupI0mzLk1Gc&index=5,0

Thank you for providing such clear and well considered demonstrations on Lambda and associated services.  Brilliant!,0
I've watched a couple of your videos on Typescript and VS code. You have a really good grasp of explaining things in very straight forward and easy to understand manner. I have been reading some documents online on these very topics and those authors make everything way too complicated than necessary. Your short concise videos are refreshing.,0
+Joe Lau Thank you for the kind words!,0
+Phillip C I made a custom keyboard shortcut for it. Maybe I should make a video series on Visual Studio Code ;),0
Is there any advantage to using the AWS command line tool over the web interface?,0
"Both should have more or less the same functionality. However, the benefit of the CLI tools is that you can automate them with scripts or with a continuous integration service like Jenkins or Travis.  And in the case of Lambda: it's faster to use a CLI tool to deploy projects with multiple files. Otherwise you have to manually zip them and upload them in the web console. But again, both ways accomplish the same thing.",0
That clears some things up. Thank you!,0

You have to change the DNS settings of your domain. Make a new subdomain (for instance: mybucket.mywebsite.com) and make it a CNAME record that points to your bucket.   There is an explanation online here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingCustomURLs,0

"I need for load balance, what different cloudfront and load balance",0
CloudFront doesn't do load balancing. They take your content and cache it around the world. If you want true load balancing you have to use ELB.,0
"Few things:  - You ""think"" your server is working fine? Test it by connecting to it directly and seeing if it works. - Make sure that you didn't create an endless loop:    -> If you configure CloudFront to use your www.domain.com as origin AND you point your www.domain.com to CloudFront, you have effectively created an endless loop.     -> So make sure that your CloudFront origin is using either your servers IP address to directly connect to it, or that it uses a different subdomain to directly connect to your server.",0
"Hi,  Yeah I  can connect to it through ssh. -- you r right it is being in endless loop. Thanks a lot. -- I think I can't use IP address (elastic IP from amazon ec2) as the origin domain name, it has to be a domain name. So I am thinking this:    1.  create a sub domain (e.g. cdn.example.com) as the origin domain name for cloudfront distribution    2.  In DNS settings: cname: cdn.example.com points to the server ip (@)    3. In DNS settings: cname: www points to the domain url (xxxx.cloudfront.net) from cloudfront distribution    4.  add www.example.com example.com as the CNAME in cloudfront Distribution   what do you think? did u do the same for your website? or something else.",0
"I would do something similar in your case, but I would name it ""vps.example.com"" or ""server.example.com"".  My website isn't hosted on a regular server. It's stored on Amazon S3 and you link CloudFront directly to it.",0

I'm not sure what causes the problems. Could be a bad configuration or wrong username/password combination.

you saved my day therefore I will subscribe to your channel :),0
helpful :),0
"Thanks for response ,  each day i'll get 5 mb to 100 mb new data which i have to transfer into cloud.",0
"I think Kinesis is overkill for 5-100mb of data per day. It's really meant for analyzing data that is being generated/received at a very high rate.   There are many options available:   1) Upload your files to S3 (many tools available). Let the S3 bucket trigger a Lambda function that reads your new files and puts them into RDS/DynamoDB.   2) You could also write a small script that runs on your computer to directly import the data into DynamoDB/RDS with the SDK. Then you wouldn't need to store in S3 and you don't need a Lambda function.   Either one will work, it just depends on wether you want to keep all the input data in S3 or if having DynamoDB/RDS alone is enough.    Hope it helps!",0

"1. There is just 1 official AWS SDK. You can find SDK's for a lot of programming languages here: https://aws.amazon.com/tools/  2. No, EC2 is not required for Lambda. Amazon handles all the scaling for you if you use Lambda's. You just have to give them your code.",0

Nice Video. I got the certificate from AWS. But my website is hosting on GoDaddy. How do I enable https?,0
You can use the same image or any other Docker image. Try to pick the one that has all the software that you require for your build.,0
"As said in the video and description: you can only use this certificate with CloudFront or ELB. If you want to enable it, put CloudFront in front of your website.",0

"+SK WASIM JAVED ALI You can't download it really. But why would they want a certificate? After the sale, they can request one themselves.",0
I think now there is a solution for this. Reading the issues on Github I've found there's a new parameter to push action wich auto initiates: git ftp push --autoinit ...  So there is no need to change the script after init.  https://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp/pull/331,0

"Very nice video, But I also want Jenkins to pull new code to the server after each push. How can this be done?",0
"What are you trying to achieve?  When a Jenkins build is started, Jenkins will download all your source files from your SCM (git, svn, ..). That is by default, you don't need to do anything for that. In other words: your repository will be cloned in a directory on your Jenkins server.  It sounds like you want to upload files to a different server after each build. If that's the case you have to use a tool like git-ftp or lftp to upload your files.",0
"I want what you said in 1st para.  Hmmm, I'll try again and revert shortly.",0
"Nope, the changes are not reflected on the server. How does Jenkins know the location of files on our server i.e. where is the code located on the server?",0
In this video I use a BitBucket repository to store my code base. Jenkins knows where to get my files because I give it the URL to my git repository.,0

Why is this better than giving properties like autoPilotFeature: boolean ?,0
With the Decorator pattern you'll have cleaner code (no endless properties and if statements to calculate prices for example). It's also useful if you want to follow the single responsibility principle.

"Most of the API providers are difficult to use for non-tech person. Moreover, most introduction or application in youtube or others training channels are useless for business. God!

"Sorry to hear that. Was this tutorial not clear enough for you? Could you give me tips to improve in the future? I really want my ""Get started"" tutorials to be understandable by everyone.  Any tips would be appreciated!",0
"This demo only shows how to connect API Gateway to Lambda, that is noted in the video title. In the next video I'll show a practical example of passing data from API Gateway to Lambda (which is like THE most important thing an API does).  Your question (getting data from spreadsheet or database) is not related to API Gateway because it doesn't support that. API Gateway just receives requests from users and passes it along to your backend (that could be a server or a Lambda function).",0
That would be interesting to benchmark. But I expect the results to be fairly similar. I don't think optimizing this will yield huge performance gains. But I could be wrong ;)  Let me know if you benchmarked this and I'll include it in the video description.,0
"Could you use Route53 to create a more friendly uri for your lambda function? Not sure if you've covered this - I haven't seen all your videos on this topic yet, but this series has been really helpful. thanks!",0
"Yes you can. Just make a CNAME record that points to your API URL and you're all set. I haven't made a video about it, but I will in the future! Thanks for the suggestion.",0

"Awesome video man, just one question how I setup emails on AWS? do you use amazon workmail or you setup server on EC2? I am asking because of the email verification process on SSL that you mention, thanks!",0
You don't have to setup email on AWS to use Certificate Manager. You just need to be able to receive emails on your domain. Usually every webhoster includes this feature.,0
I'm facing the same problem. Did you resolve it by any chance ?,0

Why not pass the original callback func to docClient.put() ?,0
What exactly are the rights that you should lock the users down to? Is there a reference somewhere?,0
"My ""Resource Name"" and ""Method"" boxes do not pop up when I set a trigger.

Please advise about the Resource Name and Method please.",0
"HI again. I got connect my domain with cloudfront. My web is online now, but when i login and redirect to other page, the session is lost. And browser returns to login page.",0
"You could do that as well, but it's better not to. You don't want to give people the exact response of your DynamoDB operation. You should hide it behind a more generic error message.",0
"There is no reference, but in general you should only give your Lambda functions the rights that it actually needs. For instance: if your function never deletes data from DynamoDB, then don't give it that right.",0
"The newer version of Node is no problem. Everything should be backwards compatible (I've migrated many functions already).  It appears that configuring a trigger from the Lambda console is not always working for everyone. Try to disable your adblocker when doing it. If it doesn't work, go to the API Gateway console and link to your Lambda from there.",0
Make sure that CloudFront forwards all cookies to your Origin. That should fix your issue.,0
"But you still output the same error message that dynamodb would, or am I missing something?",0

"You should use AWS Route53 for that and create an ALIAS record to your S3 bucket. If you don't use Route53 to manage your DNS, you should create a CNAME record.",0

Grete tutorial sir. You saved my life.,0
Yes i have installed .Version is 2.3.2. I was doing some angular 2 fundamentals well. But don't know what is happening here.,0
Got it right this time.don't know what went previously.but had to uninstall everything  and install it again.Thank you by the way.,0
Glad I could help! Lambda is really an awesome service ;),0
Savjee great video once again. Not exactly related to your video but can you explain your folder structure/application layout when you are developing an app that uses typescript for both the client and server (node) ? i.e. does the client app 'live'l within a folder inside the server app (i.e. only one package.json) or do you split it out to do completely separate folders (and thus 2 package.json),0
"There are different approaches that would work in this scenario. I'm using this one:  - Separate directories for backend and front-end - A separate directory for all the ""core"" files that are completely shared between both.  These core files can be included in your front-end and back-end projects by using git submodules or plain symlinks. In the core I keep all my models and everything else that is used by both the front-end and the back-end.   That's just one way, and I'm sure there are many other alternatives you could use.",0

"awesome series, thanks! I have a dynamodb streams+lambda design question, and maybe Stackoverflow is a better forum for this question, but Savjee, let me know if you know the answer off the top of your head or have a userful link. If I have something like a private messaging app, with each record in dynamodb being a message from user X -> user Y, how would I arrange for concurrent processing with lambda functions, but ensure in-order processing of messages per recipient? In other words, process incoming messages in general in parallel, but incoming messages to Bob in series. Thanks!",0

Hi. Im new to design patterns and I see a lot of design patterns use interfaces. My question is why on your example you use abstract? Is it also possible to use interfaces?,0
"Abstract classes and interface may look like the same thing, but they have some important differences:  - An abstract class can have a default implementation for methods. That means that if you extend the abstract class, you will inherit the default implementation of that method, without having to do anything. - You can only extend 1 class (abstract or not) but you can implement many interfaces.",0
Great videos and I have learned basics very quickly,0
"Thanks for the git-ftp intro..  btw, a `symbolic link` always uploaded by git-ftp as an individual files?  is this a git-ftp specific behavior? Thank you..",0
how do I enable it if I am not using Cloudfront?,0
You can only use the SSL certificate with CloudFront or ELB. No other services at the moment..,0
"Hey man, loved the video. It'd be really helpful if you could tell me how I can integrate autocomplete with Apex & Atom (IDE that I use).",0
what if I am using CloudFlare instead?,0
"My understanding is this. I welcome correction, if I have it wrong though. :-)  SSL on CloudFlare will secure traffic between your site visitor (who hits the CloudFlare CDN, instead of your webserver). However, CloudFlare doesn't natively secure traffic from CloudFlare to your webserver. This setup is Flexible SSL. To have end to end SSL, you need both CloudFlare SSL configured and a cert installed at your host, in this case AWS.  CloudFlare can be configured to do HTTPS rewrites, and attempt strict SSL. Essentially, if it sees that your webserver is calling an asset from http://anything.com/any-asset, CloudFlare will try to rewrite it as httpS://anything.com/any-asset. However, under this setup, if you disable CloudFlare for any reason, your site would be http.  I hope this is helpful.",0

i am doing automation using jenkins . I want to deploy code from one salesforce org to another salesforce org.  I have integrated jenkins with bitbucket but jenkins deploy all the code (commit and not commit both).

"Hello Savjee, Good Evening. I want to know some more about DynamoDB. I want to send sensor data to DynamoDB table. For that 1.

thanks.. yeah I use cloudflare and managed to get https setup..,0
"Very good video, helped me to implement my first pipeline with git-ftp.  The question I have is how to execute a pipeline when the repository is automatically updated, or is this not possible?",0

"By default Jenkins will build all branches, but you can configure that. You can set it to only run for your master branch or any other branch.",0
What's the difference between the decorator pattern or the decorate annotation? Are they the same thing but implemented differently?,0
"Really? It didn't work for me because curl had some problems. I'm using the image ""ubuntu:latest"" instead which works fine. The default image is running on Ubuntu 14.04, ubuntu:latest is running on 16.04 which made a difference for me. I found this issue because the git-ftp command I'm using worked on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (which runs Ubuntu 16.04), but it didn't work on the Bitbucket default image although I copied it into my yml file.",0
Just a little side note: You probably shouldn't do `git ftp init` over bitbucket if you're on the free plan. For me it took 48 min 49 sec. It ate almost all my 50 free minutes. It should be fine if you do that on your local machine (on Windows 10 you can use bash to do that). That way you also don't need to change the command in your pipeline configuration file.,0
Very useful note! Are you deploying a big application? 48minutes seems quite excessive. But I agree that people should be aware of the 50minutes free tier.,0
"The pattern is a solution to a common problem and something that you have to implement yourself. The decorator annotations are very different, they are a feature of the language that you use. They are definitely not the same thing!",0
"I was deploying a Craft CMS based website. This are ~3,500 files. Copying many files just takes pretty long. But I'm wondering if it's a good idea to deploy the CMS itself. I'm still figuring out how exactly deployment of a website should be automated.",0

I just wanted to say congratulations on making a really great tutorial. I love the way you walk through every step as if using AWS for the first time (like somebody watching this tutorial would) and then addressing errors as they come up naturally. Really great format for learning >>> I really appreciate you >>> I will definitely check out your other videos.,0
excellent!,0
thx,0
"hi, Savjee :) thank you by this tutorial, the command used here Is it the same for windows system on the console ? because you have a Mac (Apple) computer.",0
It should be the same yes ;),0
Savjee great series of videos really help a newbie like me easily understand and follow thru setting up my first lambda app...looking forward to the next video of connecting to the api gateway service,0
"Thanks, I wish I had this a week ago :-). Looking forward to the rest of the series.",0
triggering lambda to S3 is what missing in your series,0
"Hello Savjee, Thanks for great video! I am new to Jenkins and i am trying to build my own theme with company logo embeeded on it. As you have demonstrated in video i have done and downloaded CSS file. But i am not sure where i need to copy it and what would the URL of theme CSS? Could you please help with this",0
Do you mean triggering a Lambda function when you upload a file to S3? I will add that to my list. Potential candidate for my new Serverless series. Thanks a lot!,0
"Hi savjee.  I want to start build automatically when i merge code in bit bucket Dev branch to QA branch so i have used ""Build when a change is pushed to Bit Bucket"" in Jenkins and i already set my web book URL in bit bucket. How to start build automatically after only merge.?",0
"Samething i have done but when i checked webhook->View requests in bit bucked then, It's showing timeout error",0
Then something is wrong with your Jenkins installation. You mentioned before that you run Jenkins on your local machine. As I've said before: you cannot use webhooks when your Jenkins installation is on your own machine. BitBucket cannot contact your machine because it's not on the open internet.,0
"Can you please provide me some steps that I will follow up related to the jenkings and webhook installation , means should I need to install jenkins on remote machine or any other steps,it will be helpful for me. Thanks In Advance .",0
"Yes, you should install Jenkins on a remote machine. I suggest using a VPS provider like DigitalOcean or Amazon Lightsail. Whatever you prefer. Installing Jenkins on these machines is pretty easy, follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXlN-f6Uk64&index=2&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiSaisKr7OnM4Fl7JXCDDcmt",0
"In your other videos, you've used Apex to deploy. I'm sure there are tons of other frameworks out there that handle deployment. Can you talk about all the frameworks out there (serverless, apex, others) and rate their pros/cons?",0
"Great video series! One thing I would like to see are best practices for designing multiple functions (how that structure looks in source code and integrated in API Gateway). Additionally, it feels like with the products/tools Amazon offers, the need to create an Express api app has gone the way of the earth and you should start designing your applications with a CLOUD FIRST approach now. Does that make sense? Where does an Express api app fit in the serverless ecosystem?",0
That is an interesting idea! I'll definitely make a video in the future that shows how to structure your project for multiple functions. But basically it's as simple as adding them to the serverless.yml file.  Express is indeed not so relevant if you're using Lambda. API Gateway largely replaces the functionalities of Express.,0
"Sure! Would like a video about that? In summary: Serverless is the most complete one and also the most robust. Frameworks like Apex make direct API calls to update your functions.    The big strength of Serverless is that it uses CloudFormation to deploy your functions. That means that you get consistency. When something goes wrong during a deployment, CloudFormation will rollback all the changes so that nothing gets deployed. It's an all or nothing situation and this avoids the problem where some of your functions are updated successfully and others failed updating.    Another strength of Serverless is that you can let it deploy other AWS resources. So let's say that your app needs some Lambda functions, an S3 bucket, some DynamoDB tables, ... Well you can define all of that in the serverless.yml file and it will deploy everything for you. If you ever need to move to another AWS account -> simply redeploy and your entire infrastructure will be ready for you.   Oh and don't forget that Serverless has support for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and IBM's cloud!",0
"Thank you for confirming that Express isn't really relevant in the Lambda world. I've been trying to find that confirmation everywhere but no one's really said that. There are node packages to lift an Express app up to Lambda, but little is said on what the best practices are going forward i.e. that, once you're whole Express app is on Lambda, you should then migrate all your endpoints over to individual lambda functions, etc.",0
so i have a certificate that is issued and in use. I have created a cloudfront distribution and set the origin as my domain and linked the certificate to the distribution. All fine so far.  Then I need to add alias to my domain. So I created https.mydomain.no and added the cloudfront distribution domain. However i get a server error when i try to access the https address. I'm sure my error here is with DNS but I don't know what i'm doing wrong.   I didn't set up the domain with Amazon so i'm not sure how it's stored. It doesn't seem to be a S3 bucket. But i see the address is a hosted zone. I'm new to AWS and have no clue how to fix this.   Any help greatly appreciated.,0

"Hei Savjee, very nice video-serie. When are the next video coming ?

"The title of this series is ""Getting started with AWS Lambda"" and that's exactly what it is. This means you have to have at least some basic knowledge about programming languages, NoSQL database concepts etc. If you're totally new to web development, no wonder you it's useless for you. But there's just no ""easy and quick"" way to get a grasp of it, you have to know the basics. It's like asking: could you teach me how to write games but without that all programming language nonsense?  My opinion on the series: I had no idea how to start with AWS lambda. Moreover, the official AWS is lacking a quick introduction into the Lambda stuff. After completing this course I'm actually able to create a small real-life application like a very simple blog or a ""to-do"" application using Lambdas, Api Gateway and DynamoDB. So, definitely the author wasn't talking only to himself :) And for that I'd like to thank you, Savjee.",0
"hands down, best tutorials on youtube, keep it up. You are an impressive teacher, very easy to follow",0
Thanks a lot!,0
"You can, but it's rather difficult. GitHub needs a way to access your local Jenkins machine. However your modem/router will prevent that from happening (NAT). It's also likely that you have a dynamic IP address that changes every so often. So to make it all work you need 1) to configure port forwarding on your router and 2) a fixed IP address or a service that automatically links a domain name to your dynamic IP (like DynDNS, ..).   It's not that easy to set up, and it's pretty fragile. Consider renting a cheap VPS somewhere and running Jenkins from that.",0
"Sure you could do that! But then you'll need a CI tool like Jenkins, BitBucket Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline, ...",0
"Great question! I should make a video about this. Basically you should put all of your logic that works with AWS services in different files (and different classes). When your function starts, you should ""bootstrap"" it and give it a reference to all these files. In this ""bootstrap"" step you can detect if you're running locally and pass along mock objects instead.   The Serverless framework has a simple example here: https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/testing/ You pass along concrete implementations through the constructor in this case.",0
"Yes I know. It's not a good practice, but unfortunately the Serverless people haven't published a list of permissions yet. They are adding new features all the time, so it would be very restricting for them. I'll update the description as soon as they publish something ;)",0

Thanks for such a great information....can you please upload a video like How to trigger Jenkins job from JIRA (with/without using webhooks)?,0
Savjee so easy to pretend you know something while making a bullshit hello world and thumping your chest. real applications have real challenges lol.,0
"Hi Don! I'm not pretending that I know something and I'm not thumping my chest. I've created a few backends, build on AWS Lambda and I really liked it. I genuinely try to make good video's and help others to get started with Lambda as well.    I appreciate _constructive_ feedback, so could you please tell me what a ""real application"" with ""real challenges"" means? Does a ""real application"" not need a database?",0
I'm not sure you can work around that issue. You need one of those emails. Is there are reason why you cannot create one of them?,0
"Hi Franklin! You're absolutely right! Plain text environment variables should only be used for non-sensitive stuff such as the name of DynamoDB tables. I guess API's keys for services such as Google Maps could also be stored there. As long as you keep your code private. Or am I wrong?   Also, thanks for the video suggestion I'll look into that plugin ;)",0
Hi! I don't have much experience with JIRA so making a video on it will be difficult. There are however some resources on the web that could help you.   - Here is a JIRA plugin for Jenkins: https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JIRA+Trigger+Plugin - Someone suggests that you could use the Jenkins API for this as well: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30080978/how-to-trigger-a-jenkins-job-from-a-status-change-in-jira,0
"Hi! Sorry for the late reply, your comment was stuck in spam. I see that your SSL certificate isn't working yet. Could you walk me through the steps you have done?",0
"I guess it would be considered ""best practise"" not to store any keys, passwords etc under version control for many reasons: • Once you start making exceptions you'll gonna lower your security threshold further on.  • Your repo might be private now but who knows if you gonna share it with someone later on • Once inside your VC it'll be there forever unless you make the effort to try to delete the history • ...  If you do have it private, you might want to think about encrypting it.  Concerning the Google Map API key, I guess someone could find a good use for that and push you to the rate limit :)",0
"Yeah, you are right. This video is showing a bad example with the API keys. I'll add that to the description and try to make video about properly encrypting secrets.",0
Looking forward to! Keep up the great work!,0
"Hi,            Thanks for your reply. SSL isn't working still.            We are using Amazon lightsail server. HAve aded cloud distribution and tried to install SSL but unable to install. While using SSL it shows error. If you provide guidance it would be helpful",0
It would be totally overkilling to use VS in this video.,0
"Hi Sav, Good tutorials... i'm just curious what is the difference between this series and the one you created in december? i want to know if i should start here or with that one from the past",0
"+Bryan Luu The last series doesn’t use the Serverless framework. You had to set up everything yourself: create functions, configure them, create endpoints in API Gateway, ...  the main principles are the same, but Serverless framework automates a lot for you. I would recommend starting with this series and maybe watch the DynamoDB videos of the previous series if you want to persist data to DynamoDB.",0

Awesome video - worked perfectly thanks,0
"Hi, Savjee. I disagree with your example. Abstract class CarOption have nothing in common with abstract class Car. They both have description and price, but it doesn't  matter here. You didn't have to mix them in single class hierarchy. Probably the good idea to create common interface ""Valuable"" with one single method cost and implement this method in Car and CarOption classes.",0

Thank you! Only the last block can be changed?,0
it's will be great if you create a. video about smart contracts,0
"Yes, in this simple implementation it would be possible to change the last block on the chain. In fully baked blockchains this is obviously not possible.",0

"het, what do you think to implement this theory in backend replacing jsonwebtoken authentication ?",0
+Ar A Could be interesting to use blockchain as an universal way of authenticating people. However you won't be using the benefits of the distributed nature of blockchain (I assume you would be the only one in control). So it's interesting but I think it's better to stick with a regular database for this.,0
+Ajay Ramesh it's Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/,0
+Herminio Garcia actually you can choose. As long as you update the configuration of your Lambda accordingly,0
"If you're using Node.js version 6.x and getting the internal server error, then you need to modify the callback as follows...  callback(null, { statusCode: 400, body: JSON.stringify(generatedNumber) });  It'll wrap your output in json during the [test] but the trigger will work as in the video.",0
"Hah, yeah that doesn't make sense... But I hope it got the point across?",0
"It should be the exact same procedure if you are using Linux on your localhost. If you are using Windows, follow the official installation guide of PHPUnit: https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html   They have a section specifically for Windows systems.",0
Thanks Man!,0
any chance of a follow up video series on expending the functionality with all the features you mentioned that it was lacking? smart contracts etc? great video man. really. Gotta love talented individuals like yourself who make this possible for the rest of us to understand,0
Great tutorial! you save my time! thanks,0
I'm definitely thinking about creating a Blockchain series!,0
Savjee please do. I'm sat here now planning the structure for a block chain for an upcoming project. Your videos would answer a lot of questions lol,0
+Ryan Wesley haha awesome! I first need to finish another serie so it might be a while. Sorry about that.,0

I started watching because at the moment i'm having problems using KMS to encrypt env variables for Lambda functions, the KMS.decrypt calls make my Lambda functions timeout.

U may also be able to get some grant money from IOTA for making the video, as they have a developer/marketing fund: http://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/05/17/iota-announces-2-million-iota-ecosystem-fund/",0
"It doesn't run on it, it can deploy to shared hosts. Your error can be many different things. Maybe your FTP username/password combination is incorrect. Maybe your shared host is not accessible from BitBucket's network (check your firewall).",0

That is the goal of this channel ;) Glad you liked it!,0

"Yes, that is on my todo list! Unfortunately I've gotten quite busy in the last few weeks and didn't have the time to complete the other video's on my list.. But stay tuned!",0
"I'm not sure that I understand your question. Right now Serverless only supports the languages that are supported by the underlying platform. In case of AWS Lambda that is only node.js, C#, Java and Python. PHP is not supported by AWS, but it supported on Azure functions. So maybe you could look there if you want to program functions in PHP.",0

"Why did you stopped developing this series, please complete it",0
+narendra techguy any patterns you would like to see?,0
Savjee all the patterns that are in GoF,0
I just used the jenkins URL with no webhook at the end and it worked for me.,0
"Can I put this code also in notepad++? If yes, how?",0
I did the same configuration my it is showing SSL we I access using the cloudfront url but it's not showing SSL on mu custom domain name. I added that domain name in the CNAME,0
These videos are fantastic honestly. Also the easiest to understand blockchain intro tutorial,0
"You're an awesome tutor! Very interesting video, thank you for uploading!   (Btw ; I took your GraphQL course on Udemy. I learned a lot! So I gave you a positive review! My way of saying thanks!  https://www.udemy.com/complete-guide-to-building-a-graphql-api/",0
How can I download the library on Windows? Because on windows the terminal is working with powershell,0
Can someone pls help me? Im using windows 10 and I cant install the library because I have powershell in my terminal,0
just use tsc *.ts --watch in a terminal window,0
"Just a small remark Xavier, while recording, I really would increase your font size, makes looking at these video’s on an iphone much easier 🙂👍",0
"Only after this video I understood how proof-of-work really works. On other videos about blockchain one can find info that miners ""are looking for hashes staring with zeroes""!!! WTF, hash is hash and always the same for the content. The existence of ""nonce"" inside vlockchain block now explains everything to me. I really did not understand how it is possible to have hash always with leading zeros.Now I understand that miners are actually guessing the nonce in order to find hash with leading zeroes and that's invested work in ""proof-of-work"" that guaranties that no other can repeat this in the same time!",0
"+Maarten Tibau thanks for the tip, I'll think about it. I'll experiment with it a bit and see how much space I loose on screen.",0
+narendra techguy I've added them to my todo list. So they will get done at some point. Now I need to find some time ;),0
Another good video !!,0
I guess you might need to upload the SSH key that is generated from the BitBucket and put in on your server,0
"Hello!! Good demo :)  The function date in the video is incorrect - Change date for data  name: app.handle Execution TEST: { }  ------- console.log('starting function');  const AWS = require('aws-sdk'); const docClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({region: 'us-east-1'});  exports.handle = function(event, context, callback) {      var params = {         Item: {            data: Date.now(),            message: ""HOLAAAAA!!!""          },          TableName: 'guestbook'     };      docClient.put(params, function(err, data){         if(err){             callback(err, null);         }else{             callback(null, data);             }     });  }; -----",0

This should follow up with new videos covering the functionalities mentioned in video. Thanks for the great effort,0
How i handle artifacts on bitbuckit pipelines?,0
How did you import the SHA256. I receive a require error. Thanks,0
Nice! Thank you! It's very helpful.,0
"Great videos, can you explain how can I integrate localstack with serverless to develop locally.",0
"Hi! The lesson is a little old. U should add in your  tsconfig.json the next parameter & it value: ""watch"": true and save. After running in cmd 'tsc -w' command, your .ts file will be automatically compiled into .js file!",0

"What's wrong with JavaScript? That you don't know it, perhaps?",0
+Manuel Ro I didn't say Javascript is bad.,0
"setTimeout(() => console.log(""Learn JS first""), 500) - An arrow function solves the issue. TypeScript is dying and will eventually be replaced by the real thing: JavaScript. It's a waste of time and effort, and a big mistake to implement TypeScript in your project since you will eventually have to migrate everything back to JavaScript again.",0
"+Manuel Ro Let's see how the future will play out. Maybe it does go that way, or maybe not. Typescript is just a tool and some people happen to like it. No need for hate ;)",0
Good stuff. Thanks for this.,0
Very good video. Keep em coming.,0
Pretty great tutorials! Thanks for these :D,0
A series on Jenkins pipeline would definitely help!,0
"Same problem here.. I am inside the folder, yet it shows same error.",0
How can i push with jenkins  in a private bitbucket  repository after a success build?,0
"i have a domain name and i want to host a static website on same with minimal traffic like 100 visits per month , is aws s3 a good option",0
+Shank Possible Sure! You could also look into Github pages which is completely free.,0
"Thanks @Savjee for quick reply , even in this video we are launching the address url of the bucket not the our own domain name like savjee.com its rather http://www.savjee.com.s3-website.amazonaws.com  is that feasible , now i am in 12 month free trial period i would love to try for few months if it can host my sample site  second Thanks for Github  pages suggestion , i heard about the same but again my use case is i want for my domain name , kindly let me know if that is feasible too as ask above",0
+Shank Possible Yes it is possible to use your own domain name with S3 and with Github Pages. Just Google it ;),0
will this work across a network?,0
+Six Ophrenia No there is no P2P network implemented.,0

Another great video.  I think you might just be the only person on Earth who explains this subject well.,0
"""Nothing fancy""",0
brilliant stuff,0
"Thanks a bunch for this series, this has helped me tremendously in my quest to grasp how blockchains/cryptocurrencies work. One thing I don't understand though is how you would now allow others to make use of this blockchain.  Coming from a web background my first instinct tells me that you need to host this somewhere in order for other people to make use of it. However, I've heard a lot about decentralization with regards to this technology so that can't be it. Is this where the Bitcoin protocol / P2P decentralized networks come into play?  Also, a video on how to implement your own smart contracts would be awesome as well.",0
"Simple, quick, easy to understand and clear!",0
profit time!!!!,0
"So the domain name url would be containing this"".amazon.blablabla..""?",0
Awesome overview. Thanks Savjee.,0
"hi...thanks a lot. It helped me to start with pipelines. when I go for git init, got following error and build failed.I am not able to resolve.Please help me.  git ftp init --user $FTP_USERNAME --passwd $FTP_PASSWORD fatal: Dirty repository: Having uncommitted changes. Exiting...",0

how can contact  you please ?,0
Thumbs up to you! Great help!,0
+Romee Ahmad Right here in the comments ;),0
+Gustavo N. Quiet Light,0
+AjustaTuTecnologia You can use the ftp plugin that is available. However that will reupload all the files in your repository every time. Even if they're not changed.,0
I've used the git-ftp and like me.. but i try use the ftp plugins of jenkins and it not work ... thank you very much... do you think that it is the best method for free shared hosting that have not shh ?,0
"+Ahmad Moussa Oops, really? I must admit that I liked it a lot in the beginning but I've been experimenting with removing the intro in my last video. It's adding much value to viewers right?",0
+amallal t l The default domain name yes. But you can connect your own domain.,0
thank!,0
"The error message says it all ""Dirty repository: Having uncommitted changes"". Commit all your changes before you use git-ftp.",0
"Thanks for the kind words!   Yes, in order for others to be able to use this blockchain, it would need a P2P network. Each node that has to announce itself on the network and find the longest valid chain available. Once that is found, the node needs to copy the entire chain and then he can start using it.   It also needs a broadcast system for new blocks. As soon as a node mined a new block it should broadcast this to the entire network so others can add that block to their own chain and keep the consensus.   I'm still thinking about extending this series with more video's (thanks for the smart contract suggestion).",0
"Haha, I don't mean that Tesla cars aren't fancy (they are!), just that programming such a simple system is easy.",0

What's the difference between type and interface?,0
"Very well done video. Steady pace, clear code, and an engaging voice. The blockchain just became a whole lot less intimidating and mysterious, so thank you.",0
"Another solid video. Please continue this series, I'd love to see part 3!",0

Very nice and clear presentation,0
Thank you very much! First time I'm trying this new way of creating video's. Glad you liked it!,0
Can you say more about GitHub,0
"Have you found a solution to this yet?  I have found it to be a false error in my case.  My repo is 100% NOT dirty, everything is committed.  If I manually retry the pipeline a few times it will usually work on the 3rd or 4th try, which proves my repo is fine and the error is itself an error.  It's driving me nuts because I can never push to master and count on it deploying.",0
"3 out of 5 times I get ""fatal: Dirty repository: Having uncommitted changes. Exiting...""  My repo is 100% for sure not dirty and all work has been committed.  Without making any changes whatsoever, I try again via manually running the pipeline and it will almost always work on the 2nd or 3rd attempt.  Any suggestions?",0
"Great tutorial, thank you.   I was ""playing"" with your code and i've just discovered that changing the ""Genesis block"" (block 0) attributes is possible (the chain stays valid). This is due to the ""isChainValid()"" method; as you can see, the method has a ""for(var i = 1; i < this.chain.length; i++){ [...]"" which starts from ""i = 1"". This means that no controls are applied to the first block (data can be changed without any problem).  A simple work-around is to change the ""for([..])"" loop (make it starts from ""i=0"" and check the previous block only ""if(i>0)"").  Thanks for your time and knowledge",0
Are you going to add more tutorials?,0
"I would not mind donating to your channel, if you have Patreon I can help you out monthly :).",0

Apex vs Serverless - what is a fair comparison in late 2017?,0

"Hi Sanjee   Thanks for sharing your experience with us.   I have a few questions for you:   At 6:00,  when you specified the Jenkins server (http://188.266.139.110:8080) then you specified the ""github-webhook""  server. but you did not mention that the github-webhook is a separate server which is NOT part of the plug-ins that you showed in the video.  I looked it up on the web and was able to download and install it on my machine using CLI ""npm install github-webhook"".  Some warning messages, but I guess it was ok. .... at this point I am stuck :-).  I don't know where all the download files were installed and I don not know how to put them under that Apache Tomcat server where my Jenkins was hosted.   Would you please help to guide me through the steps?  And here is what I have setup so far:   1 - Apache-Tomcat server.   2 - Jenkins is hosted on the Apache-Tomcat under folder ""webapp"".       all is working fine.

"Hello and thank you for these two piece of gold videos! I have a question about difficulty: should it increase with each mined block? Because otherwise spammer can improve his computing power and discriminate chain. If it should be increased with each mined block, then how should it be increased? SHA256 outputs fixed-length hashes, so eventually if we will increase difficulty by adding '0' to difficulty criteria, then at one moment we will reach the point, where SHA256 must generate hash with all zeros in it. Or is difficulty something every developer can design by himself?",0
Would be good if you talk about implementing blockchain for web applications,0

"Great video! It is clear to me how the smart contract is fulfilled in a crowdfunding case as the only requirement is to reach a certain value. However, I can't understand how a smart contract would be fulfilled for the other examples, like insurance, which you mentioned. How is the validation that someone would need to retrieve the stored money on an insurance contract?",0
"No, the difficulty should not be increased after every new block. The difficulty is recalculated after 2016 blocks.   In Bitcoins case, the difficulty is adjusted so that mining a new block takes about 10 minutes. So to mine 2016 blocks, you'll need about 2 weeks. If the network has mined more than 2016 blocks in 2 weeks time, they are going too fast and the difficulty is increased. If the network mined less, then it takes too long and the difficulty is being decreased.     So it all depends on how fast the miners in the network are.",0
I have no idea what you mean...,0
"Automatically. Let's assume I transfer some Bitcoin to someone else. My Bitcoin client will broadcast this transaction to everyone on the network. Each peer will then check if that transaction is valid. So they basically check if I have enough funds and then deduct those funds from my wallet.  If something is wrong, the peers will reject my transaction",0
You can ask me questions here ;),0
"Yeah that example isn't the best one because people have a certain idea about how insurance companies work. But if you change that view, you can imagine smart contracts being actually useful.   Let's assume that there is a company offering a natural disaster insurance. And let's also assume that the government publishes data about these natural disasters on a blockchain somewhere. Then you can make a contract that accepts a monthly fee from you and automatically pays out a fixed amount of money if a real natural disaster happened (and the government added it). A bit difficult and not all types of insurances are fit to be handled through a smart contract.     A better example: insurance for losing your phone. The smart contract could be triggered if you put your phone into ""lost mode"" or if you file a claim with the police.     Granted, these applications are not for tomorrow and will take some time. But it's definitely possible!",0

I have tried in my machine with difficulty 4 but it literally died to do it. So what kind of machine is generally used for mining?,0
+rajsekhar mahapatro Mining computers are very powerful machines. Mining for bitcoin happens largely with ASIC gear. Ethereum mining happens on the GPU for massive speed boost.,0
Savjee I have an internet banking application and I want to hook in blockchain into it. I am confused where to start from. Can u please provide an hint?,0
"So in the example of bitcoin, to acquire just 1 satoshi being (0.00000001),  Nakamoto essentially made the difficulty 8, in order to earn that? Thank you in advance!",0
+Savjee,0
"crypto-js ... you have `crypto` in node and thin layer package called hasha, which is perfect in most cases. :)",0
"Not sure what you mean.. Do you want everyone to be able to add data to your application? If not, then this is not for you. A Blockchain is completely open to anyone and it take up to 10minutes before new data is safely stored inside a Blockchain.",0
The difficulty has nothing to do with the mining reward. The amount of bitcoin that you get for mining a block is fixed and hard coded in the bitcoin protocol (actually it's a dynamic number that slowly reduces over time).,0
for which language do you need?,0
Great summary without the excessive marketing jabber.  Thank you.,0
"Line 41 gives an error ""cannot read property ' ' of undefined"". Can you help ?",0
"First of all it's a nice video. Thank you. Secondly, i have got a doubt. As you were trying to demonstrate the use case of tampering the blockchain by modifying the data of the block or even the hash value was recomputed for that tampered block, you validation API was catching it. However, if had adjusted the previous hash value of the next block in the chain to match the modified block, then the integrity would have lost and still validating API would have passed the chain. Isn't it?",0
"Yes, you can still tamper with this very simple blockchain. Which is why in the next video I implement the proof-of-work mechanism.  It's interesting to note that you will always be able to tamper with blockchains. However blockchains use a P2P network to create consensus and they have proof-of-work. Proof-of-work means that it takes about 10 minutes to create a new block. If you tamper with one block it will take you at least 10 minutes to re-mine the block (and you have to do this for every following block).  So by the time you fully tampered with all blocks, the other people in the P2P network have already added many new blocks. Watch my ""Simply explained"" video on Blockchains and you'll see ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4&t=93s",0
"Great videos ! But, in video 2, the blockchain is still not valid. How can we edit data and ensure that the blockchain will still be valid ? Thanks",0
"Blockchains are designed to be immutable and that means that once some data has been added to a blockchain, it shouldn't be possible to change it.   So the fact that you can't change it, is actually it's biggest feature!",0
"For the ""check"" , is it a  computer behavior or a human behavior? In other word, if I am your peer, do I need personally to open somehting in my computer to check , or it will be just done by algorithm",0
to the point explained for a developer...,0
"Why a tampered block will be accepted by everyone if it accepted by over 50% nodes on network ? As i know, every nodes on network have verify new block by itself, not depend on other nodes.",0
"Good question! Bitcoin uses a P2P network to store the entire Blockchain. Nodes add blocks to the longest chain. So if you have an incredibly fast computer, you could tamper with a Blockchain, make it valid again and make larger. At this point the network will start accepting your Blockchain instead of the old one.",0
Glad you liked it ;),0
"What incentives do people have to calculate ""proof of work"" or to join the p2p network (if it's not a cryprocurrency)?",0

"Visual Studio Code. It's open source, free and made by Microsoft!",0
Glad you found it helpful! That's my goal ;),0
"Hmm without mining will be difficult. Mining is there to prevent people from making too many blocks. Because of mining we get 1 block every 10 minutes. So it's hard to completely remove mining, it gives the Blockchain it's protection against attacks.  Yes you could keep the difficulty constant. But that isn't future proof.. In bitcoin, the difficulty is adjusted so that 1 block will be created every 10 minutes. If blocks are created faster, the difficulty increases. If it's too slow, the difficulty is being decreased.",0
Is this blockchain base on Sha256 algorithm?,0
"Maaan, thanks! +3 to my mark for home task. Good luck!",0

where is kept this private key hackers can not access?,0
amazing thx for share,0

Yes. But the hashing algorithm can be switched to anything.,0
I want to create a blockchain for myself. Can I use this or have any open source nodejs support me? Thanks.,0
"My implementation is rather limited, but it's available on GitHub: https://github.com/SavjeeTutorials/SavjeeCoin  Also: having a blockchain just for yourself isn't really helpful. It won't give you the security of a regular blockchain that is distributed among thousands of people.",0
"The incentive for calculating the proof of work is getting free coins! Calculating the proof of work = mining. If you find the next valid block, you'll get a reward in coins. In case of Bitcoin, finding a new block will get you 12.5BTC but it's highly unlikely that you'll find it on your own.",0

"thank you, I'm learning about bitcore, insight.is. But I'm having some problems with the installation. You can make video tutorial on this part. I'm installing it on sever centos 7.3. :)",0
Congrats !! Great video and presentation of basic blockchain concepts,0
Sure! On the official Bitcoin wiki you can find one: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork    One of the soft forks was the Pay-to-Script-Hash feature.,0
Really nice videos ! Wish you the best !,0
Good Work bro,0
nice work... shared on LinkedIn,0
Man this is simultaneously exciting to learn and extremely confusing! lol 👍😃🤔😤😖,0
Pure genius,0

great video !,0
Thank you very much.. we want to know more about smart contract it's very interesting,0
"as he showed here, blockchain creates an unalterable consensus... this is awesome",0
What kind of data? How this data is created initially? Please explain,0
Good to know ... Thanks Savjee !,0
Great tutorial! Thanks a lot!,0
excellent video thanks!,0
anthony I wasn't trying to be rude. Those are the steps in order I would check Daniel Weikert  project for debugging.,0
Wow... super video..very informative and useful one. Great job,0
I'll trade you my 17 bitcoin for 17 Savjee coin....I think it's got potential kid,0
Haha :),0
"Great video, extremely articulate",0
I need more videos. Great works!,0
What do you use for your icons?,0
"can't u make, chai[2].prevHash = to the new chain[1].hash ?",0
"Thanks for the great video, I have a presentation and if you allow me, I use it (or some of its content) in my presentation.",0
As long as you reference my video in your presentation that is fine. Good luck!,0
"Yes, you could do that as well. Same way of writing it ;)",0
Blocks can contain any data that you would like. Most blockchains are used to store financial transactions so that would be the data.,0
HI! Check out our theory regarding blockchain vs. banking system and share your thoughts on the comments section there. We need comments to pass our class. Thanks! :) https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i36lt/hey_there_in_partial_fulfillment_of_our/,0

Savjee now I get it now.. wow this is brilliant.. and although u could recalculate all the hashes it would take ages especially with proof of work..   You're really good at explaining things. Great channel.,0
great video!! part3 smart contracts?,0
So clear!!!! I loved it!!!,0
Thanks for this. Listened to at 1.25 speed and it was great,0
Hi Savjee You just made my understanding of something complex easier and now i can talk about ''The blockchain''. Great explanation.,0
"Savjee, I can get the funding to start a blockchain startup in India if you are interested to join us. Let me know.",0
"Yeah, damn man, now I think of linkedlist it's similar. However I think BlockChain is linked by hash",0
Guibril M. L. CAMARA  I think Genesis block is the first one. It has no data in it. You don't need to check if it's valid. In real life theft don't wanna to tamper a block that has nothing in it.,0
It's not completely dead yet! Just started doing some different style of videos. Is there anything in particular that you're looking for? Maybe I'll pick it up again ;),0
"Finally, after tons of videos I got it. Thank you!",0
"I am guessing AWS has changed something.. My interface doesn't match yours, and when I click test, I have to ""make"" a new test.. The test doesn't allow me to test with value ""blank"" I have to send an object, so I send {}..  Then when I make the Gateway.. I go to the URL in the browser (the way you do), and I get ""{ message: ""Internal server error"" }"" since I guess I am not sending a blank object.. Can you re-run your test and see if you also get this now?",0
"More investigation, it seems the integration response is not authorised when done from Lambda part... No idea what I have done wrong (since the front-end is not the same as this video). But once I did the ""generator-2"" custom one at the end of this video, it worked.",0
Maybe next time you could make the font size bigger. It's hard to read from smartphone screen. Btw nice video.,0
Well Done!,0
Indeed. The genesis block is hard coded into the Blockchain. However it doesn't hurt to check it as well ;),0
I give it 10 years before AI games the shit out of the most lucrative blockchains,0
This is simple yet comprehensive explanation. Thanks for making this useful video...,0
That's not how you are supposed to run a service. You should make a .service file for systemd and start that that way if gogs ever crashes it will restart,0
"Please don't describe what you would not use in production, but doing it just for this video. Do it the right way right from the start.",0
thanks!   now i understand how it works,0
"Wow very fancy, cheers. 😂",0
"Hey Savjee, keep this series going. I'd love to know how to setup a simple P2P network like that.",0
"Thanks for clearing that up for me, I appreciate it tremendously. Here's another question: What happens when two random nodes successfully mine a block at the same time and then both broadcast it onto the network? How will this algorithm decide which block is the block they should continue the chain with in that situation? Does the losing block get destroyed?",0
"Chances of that happening are pretty low. But it can occur. In that case one of the blocks will go around the network faster than the other, and that one will win. The other one is then abandoned and becomes orphaned.",0
Hi Sanjeev I am not able to finish it successfully. I got the error on github web hook which I created: ' Last Delivery was not successful. Service timeout'  Please help me out.

Amazing,0
really great video! thanks for making this so simple,0
super explain bro,0
There is no comparison. The solidity language only exists inside the Ethereum Blockchain. You can't really build a Blockchain with it.,0
I might yes! A lot of this stuff is on my todo list.,0
you have are trying to access a variable that hasn't been defined. you should run a node debugger on your project.,0
so what does the data variable look like on BTC?,0
"Here is the contents of an actual bitcoin block: https://webbtc.com/block/000000000000000001f942eb4bfa0aeccb6a14c268f4c72d5fff17270da771b9  It's primarily filled with transactions. These have 3 fields: the 'from' address, the beneficiary and the amount of coins.",0
"I always put your videos in 1.25 speed. You speak too slow, and pauses are too long",0

Very simple and informative. Thanks,0
"These crypto videos are extremely helpful.  Something I'd love to understand is why is Ethereum valuable.  And what is the difference between a coin and token?  Effectively, could you walk us through the layers starting with blockchain, then [BTC], then tokens, etc?  Thank you so much these are great videos!",0
"Blockchain is not as decentralized as one may think. Just like how the Internet in theory is not centralized, but people are fighting for net neutrality because approximately 4 ISPs controls the Internet traffic and can change how they handle people's network speeds. Coinbase is going to be the Comcast of currency if we decide cryptos are the way to go.",0
Which ubuntu version u use??,0
"No Ubuntu, I'm using macOS ;)",0
"Yes, there is some truth to your statement. Technically blockchains are decentralized and everyone who joins the network gets the same right. Coinbase is not  a big threat to the decentralized nature, the miners are! Miners create new blocks and validate transactions. Without them, many currencies would be dead. So this gives miners a lot of power. They can dictate the evolution of a cryptocurrency. It's already happening to Bitcoin. Miners reject new features because they could compromise their revenue.",0
"There is a debugger extension for Firefox as well: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-firefox-debug Haven't tried it, but it gets great reviews ;)",0

That's one super expensive coffee :) nice explanation btw thanks for video ;),0
Haha yeah I know :) I originally wanted to use 1BTC to keep things simple but that would be outrageous!,0
Will BCH replace BTC ? in case lightning network is not working out?. Nowadays btc cant be used in everyday life becuz of the slow transaction and tons of fees.,0
"Can I theoretically keep watch of forks and then when new one comes out sell my coins for USD for example and still have the original coins say in BITCOIN since it's a different blockchain, hence really ""free money""?",0
"after this implementation, how many transactions per second the lightning network will allow globally to blockchain?",0
Have already watched this video twice.  Thanks so much for this Simply Explained series - its excellent!,0
"Great video. Let's slice it on Threelly (www.threelly.com). And i'm also curious, what software do you use for recording your screen videos?",0
"Thank you for the video! So, in simpler terms, is it like a digital escrow service?",0
'Globally to Blockchain' -> this limit will remain at 7. But there is no limit on transactions that happen through the payment channels. These can scale up to millions of transactions.,0
Excellent explanation,0
I feel a major % of vendors / people who are owed money would want to get it i.e close the sheet and get it transcribed on the blockchain. what they will compromise about is to get it closed at a time when there is bandwidth available in the network to avoid paying for fees at peak time. A little like load balancing but ultimately not sure if people will want to do multiple transactions without getting paid along side. to me it feels like internet routing + async iterators / generators to maintain state of ledger until it is closed ?,0
awesome tutorials!!! :),0
Very nice video :) But please more human diversity in your character design :) Have a great week and keep it up the great job!,0
My name is... My name is Craig Grant,0
Haha great suggestion! I didn't design the icons but I'll try to make some variations for future videos ;),0
Please don’t stop making these kind of animated videos! They’re the only way I can explain to normal people how this stuff works! Most informative videos about blockchain/cryptocurrencies on YouTube stink.,0

Damn it! Good catch!,0
Thank you! Any suggestions for future topics? ;),0
Great idea to exemplify Design Patterns in TypeScript! Subbed 😀,0
Great video. I would really have liked to see example fees included so we could get a sense for how realistic this actually is. If BTC really isn't going to adjust block size fees are going to be over $100 to open/close a channel eventually. Maybe a new TV should have been the example instead of coffee?,0
Great video - what did you use to make the slides?,0
Keynote 🙈,0
Cheers - looks slick!,0
"Great video - very well explained, well done!",0
"""Bitcoin doesn't have much functional utility, but it's like gold; it's a store of value."" This is the song of the dead we've been hearing everywhere, but don't realize what it means. Bitcoin has 1st-to-market advantage and name-brand recognition. It's not like gold; it's not even 10 years old. It's advantage is going to start to flounder and Litecoin is going to steal tons of market-share from Bitcoin. Don't make the same gut-reaction mistake that those on the Titanic felt: ""This ship can't sink."" It's made of iron sir, I assure you... it can!",0
"Great, so you have to deposit money in advance and do a lot more work to buy a cup of coffee. Or just swipe your credit-card or pay with cash. This is not a good solution. Bitcoin is going to die soon.",0

"People are applauding this like it's some kind of revolution for Bitcoin. It's the most backwards system they could have developed! Imagine opening payment channels to spend your debit card money every time you went out to eat, got gas, or went shopping. You'll have a payment channel open with every store you interact with and in order to avoid fees you'll have to pre-deposit several months worth of funds into each payment channel. Opening and closing these channels is just as expensive as the current Bitcoin transactions are now.  The market is not going to use a coin that is so complicated to spend. This ""solution"" will not provide any relief for the network congestion because it is too complicated for the average Joe to ever want to use. Mark my words.  Smart money is investing in Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Get out of Bitcoin (BTC) while you still can afford to.",0
What happens if I try and spend a bitcoin on the main chain and the lightning network at the same time?  Is there risk of double spending?,0
"@4:40 least amount of intermediaries, and least amount of fees... {AND} requires the intermediaries to have enough money in their payment channel  this equals the ""Big Banking"" of crypto with Payment hubs",0
"Hmm, that's a mixture of prepayment and the original ripple structure... Nice but other coins already have it, I believe Stellar is one",0

In the meanwhile you can use a web app I developed to calculate the minimum fee for your transaction cheaperfee.com,0
"Please explain (at 3:45): ""The system ensures that only the latest signed balance sheet can be used to unlock the money."" How does the Lightning system ensure that only the latest balance sheet is valid? What's stopping Bob from just broadcasting an earlier copy of the balance sheet and closing the channel?",0
"Great explanation, great presentation, graphics and detail. Good Job!",0
Good question,0
"You cannot, because your coins are locked in a Hashed TimeLock Contract signed by both sides of the channel (multisig).",0
I contributed with Spanish subtitles. Please approve it! I even corrected the mismatch between the 0.01 BTC and 0.05 BTC of the initial tx.,0

Why can't it be automatic, open the payment channel automatically, deduct the exact amount I want to pay + fees, make the payment and than keep the channel open?

Nice tool! Maybe you could allow people to change the parameters after they inserted them? Right now I'm forced to reload the page if I want to change my transaction size. Also: consider adding some help text to give people an idea of how big a regular transaction is (on average),0
Sure it's definitely not something new! Bitcoin is catching up.,0
I dont think this is good solution tho.,0
"Yep, exactly!",0
https://github.com/SavjeeTutorials/SavjeeCoin,0
Indeed! SSH was also my first contact and a bit confusing at first.,0
Thank you so much Savjee! That is a good point. I'll work on that. Now I'm working on a tutorial of how the tool works and how to get the info from your wallet to make the calculation.,0
"So, for example, if I want to send my BTC to a friend, and he wants to send those coins to someone else, he has to close our channel first to ""release"" the coins, which should be confirmed on Blockchain, then send this coins to someone else, and if someone else would like to spend his coins, he also has to close channel? Isn't it the same as what is happening now, with just an extra worthless step?",0
Savjee so youll have a credit card for everyone you want to pay?,0
Thank you great video for dummy’s like me. Does this only concern bitcoin or other emerging tech. Let me know please thanks,0
"I'm 2/3 in bitcoin, and 1/3 in IOTA now. The problem with lightning network is that you're putting money in escrow with centralized banks that also have relationships with the merchants. Committing the transactions to the blockchain still relies on mining and transaction incentives to keep the network alive, but if people are avoiding the blockchain then it will fall apart. In terms of technology, IOTA is the front-running currency that relies on multi-threading and user participation to verify and base their own transactions on top of valid paths, so that they'll be accepted by others in the network. It's all really complicated, and hopefully well start seeing better explanations in the near future",0
This is stupid... Bitcoin will die with this kind of bullshit... Why would anyone want to go through all this trouble??? It is a lot easier to use some other crypto...,0
"So you will hand over your wealth to a third party so they can make your life easier? We already have banks for that, and historically, they haven't done a very good job.",0
You could also consider accepting Bitcoin Cash. It involves none of the hassle LN is trying to bring to Bitcoin.,0
Finally someone made a proper video explaining the lightning network. Thank you so much.,0
"The problem with larger blocks right now is it slows down network propagation giving the largest miners a huge advantage and it reduces the amount of nodes. Increasing the block size also only gives a little scalability while making the issue even worse in the future. Bitcoin experienced centralization due to the Asic miners along with them abusing the system such as mining empty blocks. Segwit fixed this and is giving Bitcoin many decentralizing scaling solutions like lightning, none of which is any less secure because they still transact on the blockchain. Lightning will increase security by incentivising people to run nodes hence decentralizing Bitcoin even more, then after this there are plans to increase the blocksize safely because it will not give the miners so much power. It was the community that had to fight to get Segwit activated on Bitcoin. Bcash has increased scalability a little at the cost of becoming less secure due to centralizing to the miners. Bcash scaling vs Bitcoin with full Segwit adoption alone would have only scaled up a little in comparison. Also it does not matter how high you increase the blocksize it will never give you instant transactions, cryptos will need instant transactions in order to survive in the future.",0
"Lightning wallet will be your checking account, Blockchain wallet will be your savings account. Also give it some time, this is brand new technology so in a year or two you will most likely be using a wallet that handles all this in the background for you without you even knowing.",0
Why not?,0
"No that is incorrect. This Blockstream conpsiracy is a brainwashing technique Bcash users have been using to attack Bitcoins scaling solutions with incorrect information. Blockstream has only a few developers out of hundreds of people who contribute to Bitcoins development, they would have no more control nor will it benefit them anymore than anyone else in the world by using the lightning network because it is decentralized. Anyone can create a lightning node simple and easy by just downloading a lightning wallet and throwing a little Bitcoin on it. A lighting node will have no more control over the funds that transfer through it than a Bitcoin node would have at making modifications to the blockchain ledger.",0
Getting instant transactions in not a good solution?,0
A balance sheet is created when both sides have signed it with their transaction keys so it is impossible for it to work the way you are thinking.,0
Nice try.  You only hope your article exists.,0
But the flaws are significant and likely show-stoppers.,0
"Hey there,   Some questions I have - I have a large Wordpress website and I have a repository that is only for wp-content and some folders in there - if I setup the Git-FTP operation as instructed in this video will Git-FTP delete files when it pushes? My biggest concern is that files will get deleted. Any input would be much appreciated. Thanks!",0
Better be the best coffee of my life to cost 0.005 BTC lol,0
When does BTC get lightning ?,0
good for start. not detailed enough. make your next video and describe all the details doen to the code.,0
"This is beyond stupid I'm sorry. And exactly what happens when the lighting network becomes as congested as the current state of transactions? It's like going to universal, paying to get in, then buying a fast pass to skip everyone but then you see everyone bought one too. I got rid of mine because of the simple fact that there's already TOO MANY PEOPLE ON IT!",0
So almost like a pre-paid gift card to a certain store,0
That seems like a really bad solution to the problem.,0
LoL 221b BakerStreet . I have been trying to understand Asymmetric encryption concept  for nearly 3 hours. None of the clips i watch explained as clearly as you do about exchanging public key. Well done. Thank you so much,0
"the real question here, which is not answered, is: how many transactions / second is Bitcoin expected to do when the Lightening Network is implemented?",0
"Lightning Network is not going to decentralize Bitcoin, nor is it going to be useful for private payments.  The logic is simple.  Merchants cannot hold channels open on crypto that can fluctuate as much as 50% in a 24 hour period.  They must convert to fiat via a payment processor.  Thus, LN is useless as a mechanism to move transactions off chain and decentralization.  It only makes sense for payment processors.  But if you're going to keep a payment channel open to BitPay, you may as well create an account with BitPay and deposit BTC to pay merchants with.",0
Somewhat like that yes. And you have the ability to convert your prepaid gift card back to cash if you'd like.,0
"Yep agree, but this video isn't meant to give you technical details. Only explain it on a high level so people understand the basic concepts. Technical details are for another video ;)",0
"From my experience I know that once git-ftp deployed something completely, it will not delete files on the server if they aren't in your git repository. However, just to be sure: make a backup before you start! Create a development environment so you can experiment safely.",0
"I agree, IOTA looks very interesting. Their Tangle network is nice! Hmm... must do some research ;)",0
Savjee thank you so much! Your reply is much appreciated and will ease some of my dread - keep up the great videos!,0
"This entire process is completely automatic. Wallet software will handle this all for you. However, the goal of the lightning network is to ease congestion of the main blockchain. Chances are that you can do your one-time payment through others. And if you can't, you can always do a regular transaction on the main blockchain. The software will handle this for you.",0
Keep it nice! There is a lot going for the lightning network but also a lot going against it. This is by far the biggest potential issue: https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800   Lightning could compromise Bitcoin's decentralized nature because people with more money can open up more payment channels and thus becoming more important on the network. But it's not impossible either. This article shows that it's possible to keep the decentralized nature (although it makes some assumptions): https://hackernoon.com/simulating-a-decentralized-lightning-network-with-10-million-users-9a8b5930fa7a,0
Proper video. You're awesome. Subscribed!,0
Thanks for the video.. now i get what blockchain is.. just a basic knowledge . Simply explained,0
Not to mention P2P network consensus and transaction broadcasting. I sometimes think writing your own blockchain is just as ambitions as writing your own OS. Maybe it is just easier to take to bitcoin code and adapt it to your needs.,0
Lightning Network is vaporware. Bitcoin Cash is the superior solution and the genuine continuation of the real bitcoin project.,0
"For example I have sold something to my friend for 0.5 BTC, these coins are in our channel, and I want to send those BTC to someone else, but they are locked in my friend's channel, so I have to release it, which is another transaction, then open another channel, which is one more transaction, send it, and receiver has to close it again to release funds, that's 3 Blockchain transactions instead of 2",0
"Just look at these steps  Currently: 1. Receive BTC from friend (1st TX) 2. Send BTC to the shop (2nd TX)  Lightning Network: 1. Open channel with friend (1st TX) 2. Receive coins from friend 3. Close channel with friend (2nd TX) 4. Open channel with someone else (3d TX) 5. Send coins to someone else 6. Close channel with someone else (4th TX)  That is what I have understood, It's fine if you are constantly sending/receiving coins from the same person, but I am not, I am sending my coins to random people / websites, I would not like to have all my coins locked with random people and wait 1-10 days before it's unlocked, that's even longer than sending BTC today.",0
I finally understood the logic behind blockchain. Great video buddy!!!!!,0
"I have no word to say THANK YOU. Your videos were amazing and helped me a lot. AWS environment have seems difficulting to configure something, however, you made create a lambda process easier to me.",0
"It will definitely be centralized, like how banks are centralized.  Blockstream has lied to you about keeping Bitcoin decentralized.  This is only one of several problems.  There is no economic case to use LN.  Hubs and intermediary nodes will need to be licensed as money transmitters and possibly need to report transactions to the IRS.  It will be very complicated and convoluted to use.  Read:  https://medium.com/@curt0/lightning-network-will-likely-fail-due-to-several-possible-reasons-336c6c47f049",0

"I'd like to add that this is all taken care of by the wallet, the user doesn't have to open the channel manually. this going to be done in the background and we don't have to open and close channels nor find routings to the final destinations of the payments. Great video!",0
John Roberts you just hating on BTC,0
Thank you so much Savjee. You are the best!,0
Best explanation I have seen so far?,0
"as a soft dev, this adds too many points of failure; simplicity is the key",0
"So, basically a gift card network solving a ""light"" version of the Traveling Salesman problem every time someone wants to send money to a third party; is this where the ""Light"" in ""Lightning"" comes from?

"When will Lightning Network be implemented? 2018 beginning, middle or end?",0
"I really liked your video, but unfortunately I didn't understand anything :) What should I learn for all of this to make sense? Is learning JavaScript enough?",0
I don't understand what prevents someone from adding the latest block on the chain.  I get NOW (thank you) why it would be so hard to tamper with previous entries... but why prevents someone from constantly presenting a forged 'latest' block?,0
"Since the block chain is open to anyone and therefore I can see the previous hash, what is to prevent me from simply adding a new block to the end?",0
Please consider bumping up the fontsize a bit for the mobile viewers :) highly appreciated!,0

"Hello, great video, easy to understand. However, I always wondered how can smart contracts could replace things like Airbnb and Uber in the case of a complaint. In those cases, the third party can be the judge. How those situations are handled in smart contracts ? Would love to understand this to fully trust the concept of smart contracts. Cheers.",0
fantastic! subscribed.,0
It's very useful,0

Excellent lightning starter for 10.,0
They also work on that idea that you can transfer fund from another canal with fund off chain to a canal that is empty.,0
lightning network is flawed and centralized. https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800,0
Nothing. Anyone can add blocks to the end of the chain. However: your block needs to be valid (i.e. have a good proof-of-work) and has to be accepted by the rest of the network.,0
Maybe you could watch this video to first learn the basic principles behind a blockchain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4 In that video I explain it without code!,0
"Not sure, depends on how far along they are with development and how much support there is for it among miners. Could be that the proposal is rejected or that we see another hard fork :s",0
Yes you're right. I've seen some people getting confused by how much 'work' this is. Should've pointed out that it's indeed all handled by the wallet...,0
"The error means that the ""getLatestBlock()"" method is returning an undefined. So check that method and make sure that it's correct and actually returning the latest block on your chain.",0
Nick Szabo is Satoshi Nakamoto,0
"Hi Savjee! Big fan of your explanation videos! Could you please explain the difference between Proof of Work, Proof of Concept, and other Proof, like Proof of Stake or Proof of Burn",0
Thanks so much for your reply. My getLatestBlock() method is the same as the one shown in the video I think?      getLatestBlock(){         return this.chain[this.chain.length - 1];     } so it looks like it should be  returning the latest block on the chain? Do you have any other ideas on what I could be doing wrong?   Thanks so much again for replying. It is wonderful that you make these videos and even moreso that you  take time to help the audience.,0
how bout just trying to double the transaction throughput instead of trying to replace visa lol.,0
I reject all white papers that mention bob and alice.,0
Bob could also top up his balance through LN so he doesn't have to make a new transaction.,0
"BCH is only cheap because no one use it. If it ever gets popular as Bitcoin or Ethereum nowadays, tx fees will be as high because it's the exact same technology with the exact same limitations. Changing a parameter doesn't change the technology and doesn't solve the blockchain problem. Increasing 8, 16 or 32 times the block size, you're still facing the same problem. Cheap tx allows cheap tx services and activities that fulfill the blocks and increase fees until you cannot use those services. Ethereum proved that point, a simple app like Cryptokitties made the fees explode despite all the supposed better parameters. Decentralized blockchain, no matter the block size is limited and not scalable to a world wide use.",0
very well explained thank you ! 😊  some more concepts about smart contracts live platform as cryptokitties please!,0
"Literally anyone can manage payment channels. The most obvious managers will be mobile wallet providers like Mycelium, Copay, Breadwallet and SPV wallet providers like Electrum but also hardware wallet provider like Ledger, Trezor. I don't see Blockstream having much chance compared to them but they sure can try.",0
This is for day use case.,0
"Once added by wallet providers, there will be no process at all. It will be managed automatically in the background.",0
This has been debunked big time.,0
c r y p t o  k i t t i e s,0
There is no mining at all on LN.,0
"You basically exchange signed tx, how can this be more simple ?",0
Bitcoin Gold is far far superior and true true vision.,0
Wallet providers can maintain the channel for them. Users already trust their wallet provider.,0
Bitcoin wallet providers aren't bank.,0
You are basically saying that bitcoin wallets are banks.,0
"that's only if bob has btc locked in another channel, but yes, you're right, though why would bob send money to himself if he could just send them to the vendor?",0
Thank you for your help. I realised what I was doing wrong. I had not instantiated the chain correctly. I had omitted to call the genesis block method inside of the array. My apologies for if I wasted your time.,0
ToddAndelin  You can alter it if you have 50%+ of the people in your pocket,0
Thank you for making it simple to understand,0
"@SuperResistant sorry but that's not correct. BCH can handle an order of magnitude more throughput right now just because of that one little parameter change (block cap). Without a block cap, miners are free to include more transactions per block. If you cap that size, a fee war to get included in the next block happens and fees go crazy high. The tradeoff is, the BCH blockchain (transaction history) will grow more rapidly... because it gets used more (since it works). BTC devs are willing to sacrifice usability right now to keep their chain smaller. It is an intentional handicap being placed on BTC so they can encourage adoption of lightening network.",0
Thank you!!!   I guess I still dont understand how the network would know NOT to accept it if I used the right previous hash ...  who's telling everyone that my data of 100 (as in your application) isn't correct if its the latest block?  Is there some central broadcast of authorized/validated transactions so the community would know that the new block is not correct?,0
"bitcoin mainnet wallets are personal banks in your pocket, which you control.  bitcoin lightning wallet pegged assets (or whatever you want to call them) is an account on the network, which gets processed by central banking hubs.",0
"Thanks, New Sub from Tone and Jimmy's Show~ Cheers! To The MOOOOON, CryptoBirdDog",0
Is it free to open and close the channel?,0
"Good explanation. However, why wouldn't ""Bob"" just use his regular debit or credit card? What's the benefit of doing it on the block chain?",0
"I think I am confusing BLOCKS with TRANSACTIONS.... and I think I've got it now.  The digital signature would have to be correct and not fake for the transaction so that the hashing function of the block to be valid.   I guess my only other question would be when do transactions actually get validated, before or after they become part of the block...?",0
"Bitcoin Cash will be massive next year. Whats the point of Blockchain? when they are going to replace it with a side chain, then blockchain is useless.",0
what if Alice doesn't have a friend like Bob ... does she have to open up a payment channel with everyone?  Also when you open up a payment channel and deposit bitcoin at the multi sig wallet who is really holding those bitcoins?  Can that wallet be hacked ala what happend at Parity?  Lastly how will this compare with Visa TPS?,0
"This is all built on the false premise that Bitcoin is not very scalable on-chain. BCH already proved it is - and it works fine. What's more, BCH is building dynamic scalability - that will expand and contract blocksizes - without limit - as needed by the network. No SW... no LN... no side-chains of any kind. Simple, clean, on-chain, and in-line with the white paper. When it finally happens, you guys have fun with bank-owned organizations extracting needless fees from your miners in order to line their own greedy pockets and get a piece of the crypto action. It's brilliant alright - but not for the reasons this guy thinks it is...",0
"I'm not a developer! What about the usability point of view? Can I just open my wallet, scan the barcode of the caffe shop and pay my caffee even though I might not even go to the same caffe shop in the future? At the end it needs to be very simple and fast.",0
That will be the case! The wallet app will handle opening the payment channel and closing it when needed :),0
"When someone joins the lightning network for the first time, he/she won't have any open payment channels. But once he/she starts opening some payment channels, it's very likely that they will be able to reach all other nodes on the network through others. It's a bit like the internet works. My ISP is not necessary directly connected to a website's server that I'm visiting. As for your questions about the multi sig wallet: nobody holds on to your coins. It's locked away by use of cryptography.",0
Opening and closing the channel happens on the main blockchain so there will be fees involved for that. However all transactions that happen through the lightning network will be free.,0
We needed this video. Great work!,0
Nice we will replace cash with cash less banks where  EVERY transaction will be recorded by third parties!,0
"""Let's say that a coffee costs 0.001 HTC.""  Did Bob buy five coffees?",0
"So you still need to make two transactions on the blockchain to 1) open and 2) close any given payment channel using the Lightning Network. Even if I wanted to open/close a payment channel at my favorite coffee shop, won't that cost between $20 and $40? Also, does anyone have any idea on how long it takes to sign off on transactions, updating a given balance sheet?",0
ah a segwit 2.0,0
This seems over complicated and worse than the system already set in place. I'll wait to see what EOS and IOTA bring to the table.,0
Good job explaining - but adoption is a HUGE question mark!  Incentives please. Cash-back rewards or something... :-),0
Usually on a kickstarter there are fees involved. Does that mean there are no fees with a smart contract? That’d be awesome.,0
This is ridiculous! Someone leaves you simple solution that works and you take it and turn it into a phd thesis that barely makes sense. Only a commie would plan his/her 5 year coffee budget in advance and deposit money in a multisig.  Move to POS and get it over with.,0
Please keep posting Blockchain video,0
so the main workhorse is SavjeeCoin function,0
what information is stored in your fingerprint? Like thats the only question i would like to know,0
Great videooo finally,0
DGuliev The fingerprint or the hash or the digest is just a number of 256 digits. It is processed by a hash function (SHA-256) in a way that given a set of data the resulting hash will always be the same. Changing even one character of that data would produce a very different hash.,0
"jfl ""it is proccesed"" ""it"" concludes information right?",0
"DGuliev well it is an information that is meant to verify another information’s integrity. For example hashes are used to share data (let’s say a big file) on the internet. For some reason we may don’t want that file to be altered during the transfer. So before sending the file we pass it in a hash function. This produces a hash/digest we then send along with the file. To verify the file integrity, the receiver passes the the received file in the same hash function and compare the result with the hash that was sent along with the file.",0
I don't like the idea. I don't want to lock my money,0
The only way in theory to find out what data “produces” a given hash is to guess the data over and over again and applying the hashing function to each attempt.  For SHA-256 you have 1/(2^256) chance to find out,0

"The Lightning Network is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Most everything it aims to accomplish can be achieved with a simple gift card. I know, I used gyft.com and paid with Bitcoin for years. I would buy a week or two worth of Starbucks at a time for example which would be no different than Starbucks accepting Bitcoin. The installed SegWit pretty much to be able to launch the unneeded Lightning Network when a simple blockchain increase would have done the same thing BUT the miners wanted the higher fees. The Lightning Network will eliminate those higher fees when enabled so the miners will be back to square one. My big question is whether or not the risk that the unproven SegWit code was worth the risk. There could be new attack vectors introduced from it and that would be a disaster. All unnecessary IMHO.",0
"A sum of parameters' values doesn't seem  so secure. Although, great video, ty.",0
Awesome,0
@savjee Thanks for this video.. Could you please come up with a video on block chain using hyper ledger fabric? no videos so far available makes the idea of immutability clear using a hyper ledger fabric...it would be of great help if you could do one...,0
But its not just about the trust between the parties and the intermediate. The intermediate provides features that are around the transaction not just the transaction itself.,0

Hows the transaction being approved if buyer(A) buy coffee from coffee shop via channel (B) & (C)? (A)-->(B)-->(C)-->coffee shop. Does all this records need every nodes to approve?,0
"I don't understand how that makes the the system so secure. If a new block is added by someone, it is automatically sent to all nodes to keep a record. So couldn't someone tamper with a block and manipulate the network just as easily? What I mean is, why is it so easy to have the ledger updated with legitimate transactions, but supposedly so difficult to update with fraudulent transactions?",0
I couldn't use npm to download stuff on my Mac.. What else should I install to make this happen? ,0
so convoluted compared to the Tangle. sorry guys but I think the writings on the wall. Bitcoins days are numbered,0
VSCode theme? I really like that purple,0
"are they really pointers? I was under the assumption that they would just have normal address pointers with an added property of the hash, which is then used for verification?",0
Quiet light,0
"If you have node installed, you should have npm as well.",0
"Well, nothing prevents you from sending a tampered block to everyone on the network. But each node that receives your block will validate it and reject it straight away. They can do this because they check every bit of information inside your block. Is the hash correct? is the proof-of-work correct? Are the transactions valid or not? etc...",0
Quiet Light,0
"In this blockchain it would work yes. However when you're running a P2P network it becomes much harder. Once a node has added a block to his chain, he won't allow changes to it and reject them.",0
Why wouldn't that be secure? It's not a true sum. It's taking all the elements and appending them to 1 large string. Almost like creating a plaintext version of everything inside the block and then making a fingerprint of it.,0
I had this question a few times already. I don't think that would be a good idea. Some people think that creating their own cryptocurrency is the fastest path to becoming incredibly rich. But that's not the reality. Creating a crypto is very challenging and difficult. Better to leave it to people who really do it well. Would you agree?,0
It depends on how many nodes are in your network. A block is accepted once it has been approved by over 50% of the network.,0
"I don't think that would make a good video. But I can help you out here. You basically need to create an account on an exchange. There are many out there but for new people Coinbase seems to work really well. It's very simple (but has some fees). If you're interested in Coinbase: check the link in the video description. It's my affiliate link. If you sign up and buy $100 worth of Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoin, you'll get $8 for free!",0
Not yet!,0
Sadly no. The network still charges some fees to verify your transaction. But it should be less then what Kickstarter charges.,0
"The costs of making a transaction on the main blockchain should go down over time when Lightning is implemented. At least that's the goal. So opening and closing payment channels would be cheap.   Updating the balance sheet can happen super fast. Only the time it takes for your computer to sign the document, send it to the counterparty and receive a response. That time should be measured in seconds.",0
"Hey, I was wondering if you had made this video yet? If so could I get link :)",0
"You forgot to address the huge elephant in the room: how much all of that is going to cost. Opening a channel is, what, $20 in tx fees? Closing - the same. And if there's no route between your channel and the store, you have to open another one. And then you have to fund these channels. So to justify that $2 coffee you will have to buy hundreds of them without all the fees being more ridiculous than the credit card ones.  Why would anyone use this ridiculous scheme over something like Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA?",0

Subscribed due to your valuable videos! Keep it up!,0
I didn't understand if the value of the property known as hash can be known by anyone.,0
Your video is good but I don't like the solution to the bottlenecks. It requires trust in another separate network of third parties so it really doesn't solve the scaling issue. I don't believe just because I trusted one node for one transaction that I want to always trust that node for future transactions. Furthermore it lowers the anonymity of transactions because the network needs to remember the relationships of nodes. I fail to see how any of this is better. Am I misunderstanding? Let me know.,0

The most insane thing I ever heard of!  Extremely over-complicated compared to Segwit or increasing the block size.  This is how the banks take over Bitcoin (lightning hub).

"You don't need to alter old blocks.  You make new ones from old ones.   Pre-cast blocks ahead, then make several new phony blocks ahead.

I'm concerned this is going to be the biggest fraud ever on all these crypto craps. They're really not that encrypted. They kind of can't be.  And you can go around the ""proof of work"".  Once several blocks are made, computers don't have time to check all the blocks new fake blocks in the middle anyways. It only checks the news block.   Oh well. Idiots will be idiots. I just hope I don't get sued for fraud. There fault for being idiots. Not mine.",0
"Sanat , that's the hidden fraud in all this. Yes. In a way you can. And you can delete old blocks, and just make new ones over the top, that have hash codes that then agree with the entire chain. The last few blocks should have proof of work, a full registry descriptive registry, then get it to other P2P by trading, then nobody will ever know... unless they code it completely themselves, that it's a bogus ""coin"".

"If Blockstream had allowed to raise the block size from 1MB to 8MB none of this multisig-sidechain-hardfork nonsense would be needed. You see we would still have only one BTC. But the powers that shouldn't be are well aware of the old adage ""divide and conquer""  Again, Just raising the block size was a simple and elegant solution that could have avoided a contentious hardfork, while allowing thousands or tens of thousands of people to have access to their funds in a timely manner.",0
"jmitterii2  Dang! That sucks!  What you have done is tantamount to counterfeiting money, that is fraud. Careful.",0

lightning network is the next step to a centralized bitcoin...,0
I have a question please.  In the example where Amy knows Bob and Bob has a payment gateway to the coffee shop.   Does Amy have to already exchanged with Bob. The friend analogy is throwing me off. Is it done on previous trades or known contacts or geographic area.   Wouldn't this lightning work only in areas where mass adoption and big cities?  In places where you are on your own or do not know anyone that uses btc can you use the lightning network.  Thank you and good video.,0
130mb is ok. Better than 1000 terrabites.,0
So there will be 0 fees in the payment chanells but there will stil be issues with the high fees to open one.,0

Thank you.",0
"Chicken and egg problem.  Say that 7 days has passed and Bob still has 0.3 btc. The coffee shop, because it is a business with normal expenses, needs the bitcoin to make salary payments next week. So in order to receive 7 days of payments, the coffee shop must close the payment channel to receive their 0.2 btc. In fact, the coffee shop does this with all customer payment channels each Thursday so that they can pay employees on Friday.    On day 8, if Bob or any other regular customer wants to buy coffee again with bitcoin, they must open another payment channel. Therefore, for any regulars, they must open a new payment channel each Friday since the coffee shop closes all payment channels each Thursday to collect all the BTC revenue.   The unknown is how much the transaction fee is to open a payment channel each week. Let's say the LN brings down the bitcoin tx fee to a mere $2 (arbitrary number but just trying to make a point) from the current monstrous $32 fee, I don't think a lot of ppl will want to pay an extra $8 each month just so that they can use crypto to pay for coffee. They will simply stick to credit card to save the extra $8/month.   Does the scenario seem reasonable? If not, please state why not. Because if it is reasonable that businesses will close all customer payment channels on a weekly basis, a lot of ppl will not use btc (even if the LN fees are pennies) because it doesn't make sense to pay an extra $8/month for coffee.   Expand this thought to basically all businesses that do not have a lot of extra cashflow. They all must collect btc sales on a regular basis (e.g., weekly). So the same logic applies to all businesses. Why would ppl pay an extra $8/month when they can use credit card (no extra fees  + plus they get 1% back).   The only thing I can think of is that once the LN gets saturated, it is not necessary for Bob to open a new payment channel each week. Even if the coffee shop closes the payment channel, as long as Bob can find a path across the network via other ppl who are interconnected with the coffee shop, then Bob can piggy back across this path to buy coffee using btc from the coffee shop. But this is a bit the chicken and the egg problem. Until the market gets completely saturated, the practical reality is that Bob will likely have to constantly open new payment channels as the coffee shop (or any other business) closes them each week. So this deters Bob from using the LN.",0
Jasper Miguel yes! Everything off the chain! Fuck the miners! Let’s complicate the fuck out of a beautifully simple and scalable network!,0
"@Savjee, you are a FANTASTIC presenter. Explaining things in a clear and concise fashion is definitely a GIFT of yours. Many thanks for sharing it with us.",0
I don't understand something - let's say there are five transactions at almost the same time - won't all the transactions will try to attach to the same latest block? And one more question - if for example 2 people make transactions at the same time - does it mean that after 10 minutes both of the transactions would be complete ir after 20 minutes because the second transaction would have to wait for the last one to be confirmed?,0
The problem I see is that the coffee shop won't want to wait to close their payment channel and collect their bitcoin; they'll want to close it that day.  Then you have TWO transactions for every cup of coffee instead of ONE.,0
if wanted to create a channel do I need to run a node and keep it online all the time?,0
"I watched a number of videos on BlockChain,I barely understood until  found yours! It is a short,simple,articulate and informative video. From Tanzania in East Africa,Thank you so much",0

"Mats Pettersson I have more clues than you'll never have. A block size is limited, not by devs but the network capacity. Basically, the maximum block size that the slowest node can handle. If you start to eliminate the slowest nodes to continue increase the block size, you become centralized. It's very basic.",0
The safe seems like a bank,0
1 GB will never be enough to challenge any mainstream payment system and I highly doubt than the average node today can handle that.,0

"Okay. First of all thanks for this great video. However I have a question about smart contract which works like people who judge in business.  When we are doing a business, things happening are not just simple as the smart contract do. For examples, what if the reason for refunding is so ambiguous that just smart contract cannot judge ? In that case human must engage right ? So my question is even though almost every business change their base technology to blockchain, they cannot cut down expenses right ?",0

Very Lucid explanation,0
"The simple explanation is that banksters have figured out how to fractional reserve Bitcoin. Get out of BTC and into Monero, DASH, Zcash, or even Bitcoin Cash, before you get caught in the new slavery system Lightning is.",0
That's can't be related to my video or the code that I showed. Javascript doesn't have low level access to your system and can't cause a BSoD. You'll have to look a bit further. Maybe check the error message on the bluescreen.,0
Sometime in the future yes. Been busy with the Simply Explained series. Been thinking where I can take this Javascript implementation next.,0
"By computing the hash of the block. It should be the same as the hash that Proof-of-work has calculated. However, verifying it is super fast.",0
It's also a lot of work to pay with a card ;),0
In theory yes. But others on the Lightning network will make it possible for you not to have a node running 24/7,0
"Well, I left out a small detail in this video: blocks contain multiple transactions. But then your question remains: what if there are more transactions then can be stored in a block? Well miners usually give priority to transactions where they can get a higher fee. That's how they decide which transaction goes into a block.",0
Thanks a lot! It's a lot of work to explain these topics in a simple way. Glad you liked it!,0
I edit in Final Cut Pro X. But there isn't much editing going on. Just some cuts in the audio and some freeze frames ;),0
The lightning network will reduce the amount of transactions on the main blockchain and thus reduce the fees. At least that is the idea.,0
"Hmm yeah the friend analogy isn't really helpful here. The protocol will basically try to find a route to the coffeeshop. It doesn't matter if you know these people, only that they have enough BTC in their channels.",0

"Please a video on IOTA that works on the Tangle protocol. It is infinitely scalable, can do micro transactions and zero fees since there are no miners.

"7tx/s translates into about 18M tx/month. Now, lets say everyone starts using LN, and no retail transactions are made on the main network, just folks converting their fiat to btc on exchanges and moving the proceeds to their wallets (or maybe even getting directly paid salary in btc). In the best case the blocks would fill by just 9M users who would top off their LN channel monthly, and if the channels were closed monthly, then the whole thing could sustain at most 6M users... I don't see how LN is scalable enough. Not to mention, not sure how many would be comfortable moving 1 month worth of btc to a hot LN wallet.",0
Awesome video!,0
Great explanation of vapourware thanks,0
it cannot work https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/iota-response/ but thanks for the great video!,0
Could you please do something similar for Raiblocks (XRB)?,0
"Perfect bro, great job",0
Who or what creates and verifies the 'correct' hash value?,0
"Many nodes can compete for creating a new block. Every node has equal chances of finding a new block. That block is valid if 1) the node has done the required proof-of-work 2) the transactions inside the block are all valid. If those conditions are met you can broadcast the block to the rest of the network. These nodes will then validate your proof-of-work and if it checks out, add the block to their local copy.",0
"I was replying when Savjee responded, but he pretty much answered the question. Each new block is only valid if the calculation to create that block is validated against it and all blocks before it. There can only be one answer and any single small change to the data would make each and every hash value different in each block, so a forged block would need to have the correct calculations for each and every block in the chain.  Now if you're wondering who created the first block in history, that I don't know. It's all based on digital signatures, so you can be sure that the data was/is legit.   The video ""Ever wonder how Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) actually work?"" by 3Blue1Brown expounds on this idea.",0
The first block (genesis) is hard coded in the bitcoin protocol right now.,0
Easy attack vectors. Theres reason why there's hate for this shitcoin.,0
"I can not recommend the iota Wallet. It's the worst technique I've ever seen. I wish I could sell my Iotas, but unfortunately it is not possible to send these tokens to an exchange !! Because of the outstanding transactions, they are not confirmed by the tangle. What a bad joke ..  How ever, great explanation 👍",0
But how would the miners know that the old transactions are no longer valid?,0
"It's not the wallet itself, I tested wallet to wallet transactions and they're almost instantaneous. Exchange to wallet transactions  take forever because they're not processed by the tangle. My transfers from Bitfinex took 24 hours on average but all went through. What improved the wallet experience for me was to install a new release 2.5.5 and change node configuration to http://5.9.118.112:14265 or you can find other nodes here  - http://iota.dance/nodes",0

"Can you do on Ripple and XRP? Also although size is reduced because you don't need the whole ""blockchain"" eventually when the network becomes large enough and grows enough to have large amount of transactions, IOTA will face the same issue correct?",0
Thanks for this awesome explanation!,0
I will research ripple! Thanks for the suggestion. In theory iota is better equipped to handle large amounts of transactions. But I'm sure it's not a silver bullet and problems will surface once it reaches a few hundred tx/second,0
I thought slow speeds is why bitcoin cash started.,0
More I hear about the lightning network less I like it.,0
So the system can scale up by reducing the number of transactions on the blockchain ? How will this effect the miners?  Great video,0

"Simple, amazing explanation. I subscribed.  Quick question though : at the beginning you mention that it takes two edges to validate a site. Which I understand to mean two directly connecting transactions. When you discuss scalability at 4:46, the site on the far left only has one edge connected in blue color .. is it considered a confirmed site/transaction ?",0
"Ppl forget BCash tps is limited by the speed of the ethernet connectivity which in turn is limited by the laws of physics, which means BCash is limited by the weakest/slowest node in the network.... Sure they can scale to 1GB and 10GB blocks, but that'll be just a stop gap measure",0

im buying iota after watching this video haha,0
I like your videos but you should explain problems also. IOTA has a lot of problems even if it's faster.,0
If I am using a light wallet then am I still approving 2 transactions before mine goes through ? Or is the load balancing server doing all of that for me ? I have trouble visualizing this if my computer is not acting as a node. Is the server acting as a node for multiple light wallets ?,0

"It will work when both parties do business on a regular basis like you and your local grocery store, or company-to-company.  But the future is not 1 coin for all your payments, it is 1 wallet that will tell you which coin has the best price and lowest fees. You will chose between Bitcoin, eth, ltc, dash, doge... whatever is the best one at the moment.",0
Well it depends. The white paper was published in 2008 and the first open source protocol was published in 2009. So it depends on how we interpret 'released',0
This is something the Cardano project wants to accommodate. Linking with other cryptocurrencies.,0
"You have to be a lunatic to think that this can be the solution of the scaling problem. Bitcoin has no chance in competing with many of the newer cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately it has been taken over by corporate interests who are purposefully trying to make the wrong decisions (like the lightning network) in order to undermine it and turn it into a ponzi scheme. Fine, we'll just switch to other, and better, coins.",0

"Yuri Mariotti I don't agree with you, I don't see how double spending can happen in the tangle... can you prove that?",0
"TheMicAmused https://www.google.it/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/6j6zot/how_can_double_spending_be_prevented/ in this link the answer points out how double spending is possible and how will be ""deleted"" (?) in the future. But the problem persist because the future adjustment is much more complex and less trustworthy",0
"No its not completely hack proof. But it's very hard to fool the Blockchain. First of all: a new block takes about 10minutes of hard work (proof of work). New blocks are created on a steady pace. Secondly: nodes on the bitcoin network always add blocks to the longest chain.  So, if you tamper with one of the blocks, you'll need to redo the proof of work for all following blocks. This takes you at least 10minutes per block but might be longer. So you'll always run behind the rest of nodes (and so they won't accept any changes you send).   Proof of work is what keeps it all secure.",0

plz explain in hindi,0
On today you would have to pay 20 $ for the transaction to the multi adress channel and at least 20 $ to cash out again. You have to buy a lot of coffee to make this look in any way as a good deal.  Can't the devs just enlarge the 1mb to 64mb without a fork?,0

"You clearly do not understand how the lightning network operates. There is no limit to the transactions on lightning because transactions are bilateral.

"IOTA is no more scalable than bitcoin. Building a large network requires time and effort to implement it. Implementation, not architecture is the bottleneck. In terms of development progress, bitcoin has a huge lead on IOTA. The lightening network will be humming away 1000s of tx/second years before IOTA begins to scale.",0
You only need to open 1 channel and you can send money anywhere in the lightning network. You don't have to close and reopen the channel each time.,0

"how many done per second, with the current value to 7 on blockchain",0
"So basically, what I got out of this is that IOTA's ""Tangle"" system can be much faster in terms of transactions per unit of time,  and it requires less memory, but it is much riskier and less safe than the blockchain.",0
"Also any amount being transferred cannot exceed the ammount on any one of the links in between you and the recipient. This WILL create the need for larger lightning network hubs (the intermediates Anontony talks about). The hub will be easy for anyone to connect to and it will have many connections to other people. Thus it must also hold a LARGE amount of bitcoin in order to serve all these people when large sums are transferred. So you get a large hub, with many connections and a lot of BTC in that hub taking fees for all transactions. That sir is a bank.",0

"Hi,  such a great content. I really value your input and effort to make those videos. Thanks.  Im sorry that I will write a little bit off-topic, but since Im following your channel - I would like to ask you about your opinion.  How can we explain this crazy volume on pair BTC/LTC from yesterday? BTC - average daily volume 1-2 mln (today it jumped to 7mln) LTC - average daily volume lately is less than 1mln (today it jumped to 4,7mln)  And the most IMPORTANT is the fact, that almost all that volume is done between those 2. So some huge amount of resources are being moves somewhere.  I have heard that the founder of Litecoin sold out all his coins in december and he claimed to purchase Bitcoin Cash.  And that is the only huge connection between those two. But I still dont understand what is happening. Both currencies are having all time record high volume, but at the same time both are losing their value and price is steadily dropping.  Any view on this? Please share.",0

"Sounds great if true and if LN ever ships ... in the meantime, Im using BCH aka Bitcoin Cash to move my satoshis.   BCH median fee is $0.03 USD vs  BTC CoreCoin median fee at a whopping $15 bucks every time you send, making it unusable as a currency for the 99%.   Its not rocket science - tiny block means transactions queue up in mempool, means people have to pay more to jump to the front and get in the next block. [ Segwit adoption of 15% has led to 5% improvement .. it is helping, but by a very small amount.  ]",0

"IOTA doesn't have fees either.  IOTA uses a directed acyclic graph while RaiBlocks uses a block lattice.  They both don't use blockchains and don't have transaction fees.   They have different methods of reaching consensus.  In RaiBlocks, everyone manages their own private ledgers and transact with each other by creating a send transaction and the other party creates a receive transaction.  RaiBlocks uses delegated proof at stake as its consensus algorithm.  This means people vote for representatives.  These representatives only act when there is an issue and conflicting truths.  The representatives resolve these issues and are rewarded.",0

You can already be tracked lol part of your ip is usually on your btc address lol. Bitcoin is not a privacy coin.,0
Its congested now and barely anybody is using it. People use all the other coins instead. With or without sidechains transactions are going to increase as more people come into the network.,0
I love you <3,0
I don't think your understanding the point of the lightning network. Not being disrespectful i just think you might need to take another look at the concept. Can you explain why you think it will not work?,0
This is my understanding. Look at the current btc network you submit a transaction(tx) and it goes to the network the network then processes ur tx and you coin ends up at its destination. The issue is there are to many tx to be processed by a slow 7tx/s network so this is where lightning comes into play. You submit your transaction and its taken by the main chain but is then split off to a side chain and multiple txs can happen there and they are not being submitted to the main chain. Once you close that side chain contract all of the activity that occurred is submitted into the main chain as just one tx for a total of two tx instead of 10/20 or 100+ ex's that occurred in that side chain. So the more side chains taking more txs will equal less txs on the main chain to be processed.,0
"I think I get it. One tx on chain would represent thousands off-chain. Makes sense. I think its a bit of an over-complication, not that it simply will not work. It feels a bit like ""we couldn't make on-chain work, so we're just gonna do it off the main chain"". There is an enormous opportunity cost that comes from waiting years before it becomes a reality. Major merchants have now left BTC and it's going to be harder to get them back. I think paying to open and close channels is not natural compared to a simple Bitcoin transaction and will cost huge amounts of $ in time. In the early days it will be too expensive to open/close channels for the average person to ever do it for a normal purchase. This is why I'm a fan of Bitcoin Cash among other reasons. There are ways to scale on chain that don't create the opportunity cost because it works right now (compression, block size, subchains, etc). LN could even be added to BCH when its ready, but by then it will already be accepted around the world imho. You can say on-chain is not possible, but BCH is doing it. I think it may be a fine solution one day, but that could take another year+ to become real since it requires every software provider to update their software to work in a completely different way. Bitcoin wants to be currency last year, not next year.",0
Inelegant? Making an external system is elegant instead of a simple solution onchain? Tell me why affect to decentralization and security please.

"Or if you look from other side (when you're in role of passive reader/listener and somehow ended recieveing correct block with invalid transaction) — yes, you check them after transaction become part of the block. But when you found out that ""correct"" block N + 1 (your copy of blockchain have N valid blocks) contains incorrect transaction whole block becomes obsolete. And everyone on network know that, because they checked that too. So you simply ignore this block and do not include it into your copy of blockchain and wait for new (hopefully valid this time) block N + 1.",0
"Yep, linked list, but with hashes (so you can't simply rearrange or modify blocks in any way without touching every block after)",0
"Not so. You're talking about representation of linked list in computer memory (list entities linked via pointers). But if we were about to save it on storage in some form it's pretty much going to be linked by simple ID's (entity number, so 0 before 1, 1 before 2, etc) or something like that.  Blockchain is linked by same IDs (ID = block number; and yes, that could be pointers if we talk about RAM representation), hashes is here to verify that nothing been changed in previous blocks (after modifying or rearraging blocks you have to recalc hash for each following block to be undetected)",0

"Ethereum is like the railroad and Cardano is like aviation. Why? A little history: Gold was the first (serious) form of money, it became a store of value, something to hodl. Bitcoin same story, but then digitally and more powerful than gold (as in having revolutionary implications). If we compare cryptos with the California Gold Rush and the Transcontinental Railroad back in the 19th century then Bitcoin is gold and Ethereum is the railroad. All the fortune-seeking ICOs are riding that train, many of them will fail, but the railroad flourishes no matter what. Litecoin/Monero etc are like silver and other precious metals and will also be around for a long time. Next step: Cardano, will be like aviation. They are making sure to get their physics right before you can fly reliably. There are almost no other crypto teams out there going about it in a similar scientific way. And once cryptos become quantum-safe we're in space, but that's a ways off.",0

Because if that is the case, then there will be the need to have lots of btc spread around in the multiple multisig channels that everyone will create. Will there be even enough btc for that to be used on a massive scale?",0
"Why do we need this if we have litecoin.  (Unnecessary)  Let's keep it simple as it was designed to be.   I own a bitcoin, for any small transactions I convert my bit to lite and complete the trade :)",0
Will there be a Hard fork for the lighting network?,0
"Hey Tasha, some of those questions might be beyond simple tutorials, but let me tell you about one: JavaScript is not Browser only anymore. Savjee uses Node.js in this example (or just Node), thats how he imported the crypto library for Sha256 in the first video (with the help of npm). It is Javascript on the server or on any PC and it's been around for quite some years. Look it up, really awesome, even when not talking about crypto/blockchain. The early Wallets of Bit- and Altcoins were Qt based on C++, then Java and Phython have been done later, but in principle it's the same logic, just slightly different syntax.",0
So yo business becomes everybody's business...and the whole world can see your transactions? Ew.,0
"So all it is, is a linked list of hashed data packets.",0
"Thank you, That was very informative and cleared a lot of doubts.",0
"A bit of clarification. Bitcoin is layer 1, for scaling we have layer 2 solution -> lightning network.  Just like LN, bitcoin is going to absorb good ideas from altcoins like smart contracts (lookup rootstock / RSK for bitcoin) and later privacy features and more.  If you google, you can find articles about how PoS is actually more expensive than PoW.  Most people have no idea about anything crypto-related so I urge everyone to educate themselves. As a rule of thumb, ICOs are pump and dump / get rich quick schemes that prey on uneducated bystanders who see dollar signs.  A quick BS check is to see if your favourite altcoin, or ICO claims to be: - Bitcoin killer - Ethereum killer - Scaling solution (already solved by Lightning network) - Blockchain for X (most likely not needed)",0
what happens in general when miners stop mining? will it eventually become unattractive to them way before all bitcoins have been mined - due to difficulty?,0
"It sounds a lot better to send my money over the internet. The developers should test the scalability of the blockchain and publish the result, once that's done then people can make up their mind if it is worth an investment, rather than acting like evangelical preachers.",0

"Shouldn't you mention that IOTA's code is ternary, but needs to run on machines (it's developed to run on the IOT's) which are based on binary code and hardware based systems - thus all IOTA code has to be repackaged into binary, leading to massive storage overhead - apparently not as efficient as they would have everyone believe. In my opinion, this seems to be a valid criticism, so one will have to see how they prove themselves in real world transactions. Also how secure this very lightweight confirmation (compared to regular blockchain) network  will turn out to be, once it starts being implemented. On the other hand, it does seem promising, regardless, they just need to address these issues.",0

"Savjee, this tutorial is amazing, really. Congratulations for making the comprehension of this subject so easy! I just can't understand one thing: why adding the nonce inside the SHA256 function guarantees that it will return a hash starting with numbers and not an alphabetical character (so that incrementing the nonce will actually work inside the while loop)? Is it something about the SHA256 algorithm or am I missing something? Thank you!",0

"Your videos are amazingly explained for everyone, be it beginners or experts....",0
"It will not guarantee. In fact, it is totally random (not really but...) what will come up as the first n characters of the hash. That makes it so difficult to get more number of first characters to be 0. Suppose difficulty was 1, and only alphanumeric characters were allowed in the hash. Then it would take about (26+10) = 36 uniquely starting hash to get one starting with 0. So the probability will be 1/36 which is quite high. If we want two zeroes instead, we need to try about 38^2 uniquely starting digram hashes. Probability of finding such hash = 1/1296 so the probability decreases exponentially with linearly increasing difficulty",0
These are golden! love the simplicity!,0
your videos are so good. keep up the good work.,0
Great ! 🇫🇷,0
brilliant video,0
But if you only want to send one transaction surely it’s the same as just adding it to the blockchain?,0

As always.....Awsome! Amazing ! Level 10.,0
i love this channel ;=),0
"If you transfer your coins, others mine the block your transaction got added to and if the miner who is mining your block gets the right hash, your transaction is confirmed and done.   just a guess, but theoretically you could mine the block your transaction is in yourself, but as far as i know this is not possible other than in theory",0
"If you are really struggling with this, you should wait before you want to build your own cryptocurrency ...",0
"If you don't change any information the hash is always the same, and since you can't (shouldn't) change the info in the block which is needed, like transaction id, you have to change the nonce so the hash changes  if you hash your name 20 times you will always get the same result, but if you hash your name and a random number, you will get different hashes without having to change the name",0
"I bought 4,000 ADA in November 2017 for just a few hundred dollars. Sold them in December during the market crash. I was an inexperienced trader so I thought that was the crash to end all crashes.

"Agree with your points, but those are traits of a market in which people don’t know what they don’t know. I’m not technically gifted in computing, nor think you need to be to understand your points or crypto currencies. So bitcoin will fix problems that they incur, however one problem I cannot see either Ethereum or bitcoin solving is liquidity. Neither seem to want to adhere to regulations, which is vital to their lives (they shouldn’t adhere in other words). I just see cardano as a solution to regulators wants and needs and a quicker avenue towards liquidity than bitcoin or Ethereum.",0

"""In Mathematics We Trust.""  Spread the word, fellow moonlanders.",0
"The problem is that bitcoin has miners which make the hash rate really high. It would be extremely difficult for someone to achieve even 1% of total network processing power (no, there is no miner with that amount of processing - a pool of miners is not a single miner, it is a *pool* if miners). On IOTA, since there are no miners, it is trivial to reach more than 100% of the total network processing power. Even if IOTA did more transactions per second than VISA, it would not be nearly enough to keep it secure. Before you say companies would keep up servers confirming transacions: they would be doing the miners job, but without the rewards, and still would be much less processing power (no rewards, no incentives).",0
"On IOTA the device making the transacion does the mining. Note that the marketing of this coin is targeted for IoT devices, which in general are low processing power devices. Thats why they have the Coordinator, which is a trusted node, run by IOTA fundation, which prevent double spending. Until they turn off the Coordinator, it is a centralized coin. They say one day they will turn the Coordinator off, but I really doubt that, low processing power devices are not enough to keep the network secure.",0
"The IOTA foundation started with all coins. It was 100% premined, but there are no more coins being created.",0
Very simple and clear and straightforward. Thank you. :),0
very nice explained!,0
Great Video! How do you make the icons?,0
"Let's see if I got this. I pay a huge transaction fee to put my bitcoin on the lightning network. If I want to pay some one, they must also be on the network. We'll probably both need to open a channel to a central node (read bank). The node (bank) will transmit my bitcoin from me to my payee & charge a fee (probably to me & the payee, they need to make a profit after all to keep this service running).  I must trust this node not to steal my bitcoin. To avoid the huge Bitcoin transaction fees & keep the blockchain from getting too big, we should keep all our bitcoin on the lightning network, where it will be very very safe (MtGox).  And the software to do this is surprisingly simple & uncomplicated. It's nearly ready to roll out, just a couple of tweeks. And when everyone is on the LN, we can actually decrease the block size & make Bitcoin even safer from centralization.   So, is this more or less correct? Have I got it? Heck then, what could go wrong?!    (Are we sure increasing the blocksize isn't the answer?)",0

"your not a ""hacker"" and you prove you don't quite understand what's going on.  That being said, no it doesn't work like that. You still need a valid hash in the whole thing.

"Will it really seek the shortest path possible to complete a transaction? Wouldn't this lead to making big hubs bigger overtime, leading to single points of failure?

"Nope.  It's still something I deal most times I deploy.  I deploy to 5 different sites (site root directories) on 3 different servers.

"Charles, why do you say ""sold themselves out to the banks""? Why would banks want to help bitcoin? Bitcoin is the banks sworn enemy, I would think that they would sooner shut down than get involved with bitcoin, even if it means losing lots of profit.

"I get your point, but i'm still thinking: who decides you made your own decision, there is no central point who can defend you and back you up, it's only people with mining machines and are in the blockchain, who don't know the situation, cannot judge what happened, no witnesses at all, only data. Is that enough to transfer buildings/testimonia/ insurance money? I don't see it happening before me, but maybe i'm not seeing this right? And still again: you only see the data, is that enough? Maybe the data is correct but in real life the things happen the other way around. A machine can't check reality.",0

"The opening and closing of channels still would be limited to 7 transactions per second and the really painful transaction fees for the main block chain.  To me the lightning network only seems to really work if the channels are just between customers and banks.  A bank of some sort that can put a large sum in that vault (escrow) for the channel open.  And no point in opening a channel unless you plan to send at least 3 transactions through it.  Plus who pays the mining fee on channel close?  The closer?  Does the coffee shop just eat the closing fee?  They could ask the customer to pre-pay the closing fee, but then the customer pays double if they close it.. and how the coffee shop predict what the fee will be in the future.",0
"Channels only make sense for large pools of BTC and the expectation of lots of transactions (two main block transactions and fees to open/close and btc stuck in escrow while the channel is open).  If you put a bank between bob and the coffee shop (Bob pays bank, bank pays coffee shop) then it makes sense (see credit cards).  The Alice example is really just adding more banks and doing bank to bank transfers.  This would eventually mean the BTC main chain is really just a ledger between banks.",0
"They will accept it when they see a way to profit from it, which the lightning network gives them. It is more or less a banking system along side the blockchain... I hate it.  Goes against what bitcoin should stand for and makes it apparent btc may be run by the corporations at this point.",0

I think it could make transferring BTC between exchanges free. The exchanges would have massive payment channels simply because of all the users they have. When you transfer it should mostly go through the lightning network.   I don’t like the solution but as long as it works and is free I guess it won’t matter if it’s a patch to old technology.   There are already better networks out there that scale and are free.,0
"""Server Internal Error"" (RESOLVED - But why!??): If I connect the lambda function with the API through the lambda I got the ""internal server error"" which was solved by making the callback as indicated by Phillip...  callback(null, { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(generatedNumber) });  However, if I connect them through the API Gateway as explained later on the video, I have to use the original's video callback or else it returns {""statusCode"":200,""body"":""8""}   Any ideia why?

"If people start using lightning, you will make 10's or 100's of payments before closing it out on the blockchain. Thus the blockchain will be less full and fees low. Also, the merchant (and thus maybe you) will save 2-4% in credit card fees for every one of those 100's of transactions.",0

"OK, so, turns out when creating the integration from the lambda console, it creates the resource and/or the ANY method on the API gateway using proxy integration, which means, the response should have the format below because the whole headers are being sent to/from lambda through the proxy  { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(generatedNumber) }  otherwise, you get an ""Execution failed due to configuration error: Malformed Lambda proxy response"" when testing it from the API Gateway console.  This can be fixed by simply adding a new GET method (without proxy) in the API console to the resource lambda created, however I think the best way to create the integration is from the API Gateway itself instead of straight from lambda to avoid any kind of unknown default configuration lambda might apply. Hope it helps!",0

The system really is that 'easy'. However many people fear that nodes with a lot of bitcoins will have an advantages over others because they can commit more coins to a payment channel. That creates a whole discussion about how decentralized this approach really is...,0

"Since in the video coffee cost 0.005btc each time, and the channel has 0.05btc from bob side, he can only pay for coffee 10 times. After that the payment need to be closed. So the transaction limit is based on how much money you which to stake in the channel, until you decide to open a new channel. There is probably some fees if using hub and most likely fees is going to be in percentage of the amount transact so that very much limit the lightning network use case for small payments ie. microtransaction.",0
"Brilliant! I really like the way you speak, easy to understand. Thank you!",0
But if i change the hash of the last block in the chain it will return true anyway because there's not a block to compare the hash with...What do i miss?,0
So does the 'Coffee Shop' in this example not get paid until the payment channel is closed? If so then this will fail and problably increase transactions not decrease them. What business is happy to wait an unknown amount of time to be paid?,0
"so richer people might get better service, essentially?  that's a little hard to understand, if a channel is just between two primary parties...if the coffeeshop's computer is connected to your computer via a TCP-like channel, why would it matter how much money is involved, and why would it matter what anyone else in the world is really doing?  if you are only writing to the blockchain once a month even waiting a few hours would be no big deal, either, would it?",0
"I really would like to know how a private key can be linked to a public key, but they can't be derived from one another. How does that work? How do you check that they are indeed linked, and how do you know that a hacker wouldn't be able to generate a private key from knowing a public one?  I'd really like to know this. Thanks for your explanation though, one of the best out on YouTube",0
"When the channel eventually closes though, and the updated BTC is distributed between the parties, the mining fee will still be enormous.... IMO This only reduces the blockchain scaling problem and not even by a significant amount....",0

"Great job on the video. Is there a guarantee that when Alice sends BTC to Bob to be sent to the coffee shop, that it will actually happen other than just trusting Bob to do so?

Savjee I am only putting Chinese subtitles on your video～ no new voice. Is that ok？,0
"No, sorry :(",0
"Savjee  this is the Chinese translation. but I have no idea how to submit it to youtube lol  Encryption is a process of taking a message and scrambling its contents  加密是一个把正常信息变得让人读不懂的过程  that only certain people can look at your message 只有会解码的人能读取加密信息  There are two types of encryption 现在有两种加密方式  symmetric and asymmetric encryption 对称加密和非对称加密  Let’s first take a look at symmetric encryption 我们先来看看对称加密  to understand why asymmetric encryption was created 之后才好理解非对称加密的强大  To do that, let me introduce you to Alice and Bob 咱们故事的女主是Alice，男主是Bob  Alice has a sensitive document that she wants to share with bob 假设Alice想发一份敏感文档给Bob  She uses an encryption program to protect her document with a password or passphrase that she chooses 她用软件给文档加密  She then sends the encrypted document to Bob 然后她把加密后的文档发给Bob  However, Bob cannot open this message 然而Bob打不开这份文档  Because he doesn’t know the passphrase that Alice used to encrypt the document 因为他不知道Alice设置的密码  And other words, he doesn’t have the key to open the lock 换句话说，Bob没有开锁的钥匙  Now comes the real problem 那么问题来了  how does Alice share this passphrase securely with Bob? Alice怎么才能安全地把密码告诉Bob呢？  Sending it through email is risky 用电子邮件发送密码很危险  because others might find the passphrase 因为黑客能轻而易举破解其中的密码  and use it to decrypt any messages between Alice and Bob 然后Alice和Bob所有往来邮件就公之于世了  This is exactly the kind of problem that asymmetric encryption intends to solve 该非对称加密登场了！  It is comparable to a mailbox on the street 假设街上有个邮箱  The mailbox is exposed to anyone who knows its location 邮箱的地址是对所有人公开的  We can say that the location of the mailbox is completely public 邮箱的地址是对所有人公开的  Anyone who knows the address can go to the mailbox and drop in a letter 知道邮箱地址的人都可以过来投递信件  However, only the owner of the mailbox has a key to open it up and read the messages 但只有邮箱主人有打开它的钥匙  So let’s now go back to technical details 回到技术层面来看  When using asymmetric encryption 使用非对称加密时  both Alice and Bob have to generate a key-pair on their computers Alice和Bob需在各自的电脑上生成一对密钥  A popular and secure way for doing this is by using the RSA algorism RSA算法是一种很受欢迎、很安全的密钥对生成方式  This algorism will generate a public and private key RSA算法会生成一个公钥和一个私钥  they are mathematically link to each other； 公钥和私钥之间存在某种数学关系；  Public keys can be used to encrypt data  用公钥加密的数据  and only the matching private key can be used to decrypt it 只有与其对应的私钥能解开  Even though the keys are linked together 尽管公钥私钥是关联的  they cannot be derived from each other 人们无法用其中一个推算出另一个  And other words, if you know someone’s public key 也就是说，如果你知道某人的公钥  you cannot derive his private key 你是算不出他的私钥的  If you retake our mailbox example 类比街上的邮箱  That the mailbox’s address would be the public key 邮箱的确切地理位置等同于公钥  something that everyone is allowed to know 是公之于众的  The owner of the mailbox is the only one who has the private key and that is needed to open up the mailbox 而只有邮箱主人才拥有可以打开邮箱的私钥  Let’s now take a look at how Alice and Bob can use asymmetric encryption to communicate securely with each other  再看看Alice和Bob如何用非对称加密实现安全通信  They start by exchanging their public keys 他们首先交换公钥  Bob gives his public key to Alice and Alice gives her public key to Bob Bob把自己的公钥给Alice，反之亦然  Now Alice can send her sensitive document again 现在Alice发送那份敏感文件的时候  She takes the document, and encrypts it with Bob’s public key 用的是Bob的公钥来给文件加密  She then sends the file to Bob who uses his private key to unlock the document and read it 当Bob收到文件后，可以用自己的私钥来读取文件  Because they use asymmetric encryption 因为他们使用的是非对称加密  only Bob is able to decrypt the message 只有Bob能解开加密文件  Not even Alice can decrypt it 甚至文件的发送者Alice都不能解开Bob收到的文件  because she doesn’t have Bob’s private key 因为她没有Bob的私钥  The strength and security of the asymmetric encryption now relies on Alice and Bob to keep their private keys well protected 如果私钥泄露，非对称加密的安全性就会降低  If an attacker steals Alice’s private key 如果入侵者偷到了Alice的私钥  it can be used to decrypt all messages that are intended for Alice 她的收件箱就完全暴露了  However, the attacker cannot decrypt messages that were sent by Alice 然而入侵者无法偷看Alice的发件箱  because that requires Bob’s private key 因为入侵者没有Bob（收件人）的私钥  Asymmetric encryption is used in a lot places where security really matters 在注重信息安全的地方，非对称加密非常常见  You might not be aware of it 你可能不知道  but every time you visit a secure website via HTTPS,  每次用HTTPS访问安全网站时  you are actually using asymmetric encryption 你即在使用非对称加密  It’s also being used to securely send emails with PGP protocol  电子邮件的PGP加密也是非对称加密  and one last example: bitcoin also uses asymmetric encryption  还有一个例子，比特币用非对称加密  to make sure that only the owner of the money wallet 来保证只有钱包所有者  can withdraw or transfer money from it 能从中取钱和转账  So now you know how asymmetric encryption works  上述即为非对称加密的原理  and what the differences are between asymmetric and symmetric encryption 非对称和对称加密之别亦已阐明  If you like this video 如果你喜欢本视频  consider supporting me by sharing it and subscribing to my youtube channel 请转发并且订阅我的youtube频道  And it’s always thank you very much for watching 感谢收看",0

"For RSA, it's simple.  You have a trapdoor function, a function that is easy to do one way but hard to pull back. To understand, we first need to know how RSA works. If you don't want to see the underlying math in generating all the variables, I've sectioned it out for you.  ----- BEGIN MATHS ----- We start off with two large prime numbers, p and q.  For the sake of demonstration, I'll just use 5 and 11. p = 5 q = 11 We then calculate n and phi(n).  n is p*q and phi(n) is (p-1)*(q-1). n = p*q = 5*11 = 55 phi(n) = (p-1)*(q-1) = (5-1)*(11-1) = 4*10 = 40 Knowing phi(n), we then pick another number e that is random (usually 65537; for demonstration purposes I'll use 3) and co-prime to phi(n) (in other words; it shouldn't be a factor of phi(n)). e = 3 Then, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to calculate d. e * d mod phi(n) = 1 3 * d mod 40 = 1 d = 27  Now, we've calculated all of our variables. Unimportant variables: p = 5 q = 11 phi(n) = 40 Important variables: n = 55 e = 3 d = 27 Note that these numbers are way too small to use in any real life applications. A little side note, modulus is simply the remainder to a division problem. Also, phi(n) is euler's totient function, which is basically how many numbers aren't multiples of factors of n below n and above 0.  For a prime number (x in this case), phi(x) = x - 1. ----- END MATHS -----  n is called the 'modulus,' e is called the 'public exponent,' and d is called the 'private exponent.'  So now we have our modulus, public exponent, and private exponent. We create our 'public key' using our public exponent and modulus.  We have a public key now, (3, 55).  We then make it available to anyone who wants it.  And we then have our private key which we keep a secret, which is (27, 55).  To encrypt text, we use: C = (p^e)%n or, in our case, C = (p^3)%55 where C is the ciphertext, p is the plaintext (data to encrypt), e is the public exponent (3), and n is the modulus (55).  If we put the number 18 in for p, we get the number 2. We can then send 2 over an insecure channel. Unless someone else encrypts the number 18 or factorizes the modulus, only we can decrypt it.  To do so, the equation is practically the same: P = (c^d)%n or, in our case, P = (c^27)%55 where P is the plaintext (decrypted data), c is the ciphertext (encrypted data), d is the private exponent (27), and n is the modulus (55).  If we put 2 in for c, we get 18 back out. We just successfully encrypted and decrypted data using a simple RSA example!   Anyways, back to our trapdoor function.  You publish the public exponent and the modulus, while safeguarding the private exponent (and sometimes the original primes).  The private exponent can only be calculated with phi(n), which is hard to calculate for large numbers without knowing the original primes.  *The only way to find out the original primes is to factorize it, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming for extremely large numbers.*  Knowing the original primes is the most efficient way to calculate phi(n) which is the most efficient (and nearly only) way to calculate the private exponent.  So, to answer your questions: How can a public key be linked to a private key, yet you can't derive the private key from the public key?  (Note that the private key usually contains the original primes and the public/private exponents, so its easy to generate a public key from a private key) As I said, it is hard to factorize the modulus provided that the numbers are large enough.  In terms of linking, however, if you read the math, you can see that the modulus and public exponent are used together with some secret data to form the private exponent.  How can you check if they're linked? The easiest way is, well, to encrypt data with one and see if its decrypted with the other!  How can you be sure that a hacker can't derive the private key from public info? Well, as I said, the modulus is hard to factorize provided it is done right.  The trapdoor function makes it easy for cheap phones to generate keypairs by multiplying in a few seconds (the biggest challenge being gathering enough random data), whereas supercomputers in universities can't factorize the same numbers in a reasonable amount of time.",0
holy fuck this was good. Subscribed.,0
Just use cardano,0
"Great job Savjee!  I do have a question, about crypto wallets. What happens if one loses the device? Lets say, private key has been kept safe. Can one recover the coin balance or not? Thank you Nikos",0
"Okey, i dont understand what is preventing me from changing the deta, in order to proove my work insted of updating the naun verible, and that way change the information",0
"Hi @savjee. Great video mate. Thank you for providing info on blockchain tech. I have a quick question, how do you create these animation videos? Its really cool.",0
"Wow ! Really good video man (simple, perfectly explained and beautiful), thank you very much !!",0
kudos,0
"Thank you, good review. A promising project for investors and all participants is the TokenGo project. There are many assumptions about where you can invest your money. I would advise TokenGo, this company has modern technologies in the field of ICO. Allows them to lead, and also has for this all the necessary functionality.",0
Very nice. Thank you,0
"We will see how this ends up being translated in daily use but seems very complicated the way i imagine it. Like having to open your app, open a channel with someone, deposit BTC on that channel and then start making payments? Hmm not too sure about this",0
I did not understand how you can calculate all the hashes of a blockchain after tempting with one block (mentioned at about 3:00 minutes). How do you do it since you don’t know all the following blocks current hash?,0
Iota isn't a blockchain /sigh,0
Hamed Alwafi Satoshi is Elon Musk!! Heaps on info out there about it!,0
YOU ARE AWESOME DUDE! have a take home project for my dev interview and this playlist is saving me,0

"""An increase in the block size limit would also likely mean that the requirements for full participation on the Bitcoin network would increase. With more transactions taking place on the network, the system requirements for operating a full node will also increase. If those requirements are increased too much, Bitcoin would become more centralized and look more like PayPal than the decentralized, censorship-resistant network that everyone has come to know.""  http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-matters-cm645644",0

Great Video,0
"What are your thoughts on ""womencoin"" dead serious it's a coin",0
Complicated,0
Cardano ok.  Iota lies,0
"I'm wondering what would be the fee, ones the BTC are send to the mainblock? And who is gonna pay for that?",0
"IOTA is not a blockchain. It's a DAG or Tangle technology.  There is also this new thing called HASHGRAPH. But not sure about what it is, frankly.",0
The definition of a Blockchain also fits IOTA. It's a series of grouped data or 'blocks' that are timestamped and cryptographic signed.,0
"Yes, that worked. No need to separately configure api gateway with the console.",0
"great video, thank you very much.",0
You left the entire useful information that you would not find elsewhere in this simplicity only to stick with this marginal unimportant unintended mistake.,0
Can you a make a video on choosing the longest chain?,0
"Yep, and IOTA doesn't use that. They use what they call a Tangle. They even say right on IOTA's front page ""The main innovation behind IOTA is the Tangle, a revolutionary new blockless distributed ledger""",0
"I know. I explain it in my video on IOTA, thanks! But it's very similar. Both consist out of units of data (blocks or sites) that are linked together in a cryptographic way.",0

I still dont get where the history of transactions is stored... :/,0
Those seems very insecure. Very easy for fraud to creep through,0
"You say the location of the mailbox is the public key. So that would be for example an email address?  If that is right, I can't seem to follow until the end. How do you give someone your public key as it's an address that everyone may already know. If everyone knows it, everyone can access it. That's where I can't follow. How does the system know that it is only for a specific person's eyes? Also, if you set a password on a PDF file for example, the other person would need the password aka the private key. Just like you said, if you send that password over email, other people might be able to access it. How do you solve this problem?   Very nice video btw!",0
MiccaPhone lol. triggered purist,0
Brilliantly explained.  Thanks a lot.,0
7 transactions a second? source? AHAAAHAA,0
"Thanks for the video, very nice work, but there is one concern: So you do not need to open a channel, it will just use the channels of other people. You send 0.001 BTC and one of those guys between decides to close the channel, meaning your funds will be written to the chain and you pay a big part of the fees. Doesn't sound like a solid concept, if you ask me.",0

Very nice introduction. Perfectly explained concepts in a compressed timespan.,0
Keep making great videos like this Savjee!,0
"They are not bugs, you dumb. They are exploits that make use of one of the processors features.",0
Yes. Exploits that take advantage of the bugs in modern processors.,0
"Savjee since when a FEATURE is a bug? Speculative excecution it's not a ""bug"", it's doing what it's suppossed to do. Run the tasks before you tell the computer to do it so it can load everyting faster for you.",0
Guess you didn't watch the video! Speculative execution is a feature yes. But it should never speculate when kernel memory is involved. That's clearly an oversight in the cpu design. A problem. A mistake. A bug.,0
neo can do all that too,0
"crystal clear, excellent job!",0
Excellent man! great tutorial,0
Activate the subtitles in this YouTube video.,0
"I wish everyone in life was explained in OOP, damn fun to watch. Keep it coming, create a Wallet class Savjee! I’m curious, did you make all properties and methods public just for the tutorial? The Chain and Block classes are so exposed it would be very simple to alter, no? IMHO the properties should be private at the least.",0
Great work thanks so much!,0
Yes everything is public. Javascript doesn't have 'private' properties.,0
"Amazing! Please, keep up making this series!",0
"Savjee I’m aware, didn’t literally mean public/private, I meant public as in own property, and thought there were ways of achieving private properties with symbols, closures, weakmaps, etc., was just curious to your thoughts on this. I dunno. Love the tutorials!",0
What video software do you use?,0
Nice video,0
What theme of the vscode?,0
Love it dude. Do you think you could make a video on permissioned blockchains? Like giving permissions to certain parties. Thanks!,0

Does the transactions are encrypted? since the miner come to know about transactions (who sent amount to whom) ?,0
"What mechanism ensures only the latest balance sheet is used? If the network is unaware of these balance changes, how could it possibly know a newer one exists? Also how is each key validated off network exactly?",0
"Way overvalued, this project just started and is rank 5 coinmarketcap, i call bs",0
Ok but I have one question. Who pays .05 for a coffee?,0
Awesome video ... super simple explanation !! Thanks much !!,0
Yeiiii I was waiting for this! Thanks for keep uploading :),0
"Very clear explanation, thank you",0
Nice video. Is there any reason why you put the miners reward in the pending transaction after its been mined? Wouldn't it simpler to add the reward to the pending transactions at the start so that it would be added for the block you're actually mining?,0
You can do it either way. I just choose to give it in the next block to create an incentive to keep mining. But you can give it straight away as well.,0
So many people are getting so hung up on the amount... Pfff. It's just to explain the lightning network.,0
The transactions aren't encrypted. At least not in bitcoins case. The miners receive new transactions from other bitcoin users. When you make a transaction it is broadcasted to everyone in the bitcoin network.,0
"Thank you buddy, you  make things easier !!",0

You say there'll be no fees but earlier in the video you say there's a treasury that takes a cut off all transactions. That sounds like a fee. Otherwise I like your videos,0
Very good!!!,0
"Hi Savjee, enjoying your series very much! Thank you. But, aren't you forgetting to add the previous hash to a new block?",0
Yes I did! Someone already pointed it out and it's fixed on Github.,0
"Hi, Savjee, thank you for your high quality video as always, I am very appreicated. But in function minPendingTransactions(), the previousHash is missing when you create a new block. change to follow will be fine. let block = new Block(Date.now(), this.pendingTransactions, this.getLatestBlock().hash);",0
@Savjee would you allow me to use some screenshots from your video for a presentation at school?,0
"Date.now() will return a elapsed milisecends since 1970, new Date() will return the current time in yyyy/mm/dd format. Thank you",0
You can use either one of those. We don't actually do something with the date in this Blockchain.,0
"If you reference my video, yes!",0
Jep! Already fixed the code on Github this morning and I wrote it in the description of this video. Nice catch!,0
I think you're mixing two videos. IOTA doesn't have a treasury system and doesn't have fees. Cardano has fees and a treasury.,0
Savjee thanks a lot! Wrote links to your channel and video onto the prezi presentation (sadly in german language).,0
Wouldn't we need a check at the transaction level that checks the total transaction is less than the coin's MAX_MONEY and more than 0? For example const MAX_MONEY = 21000000 would be at this level? Or is the coin limit handled elsewhere?,0

"I`m not sure how much this reduces the overall load on the main blockchain. I tried to think hard and summarize all my last month payments (in fiat)  and very few where I paid twice and could have used the lighting network. 90% of my payments are unique, but this is only me, so let`s assume the best case scenario where only 20% of people`s payments are unique, and 80% can use the lighting network. That could result in a 5 fold speed increase in bitcoin network theoretically. Still nowhere near to Visa.....  5 times the current 4 transaction/sec  is still only 20 transaction/sec.  I think scalability will be a forever issue.",0

Need to improve your mic sound and maybe put some music in the video. Great work!,0
Sorry dumb question - when you change the difficulty from 2 to 4 why does it slow the time to create a new block?  Is it the increased number of hashs on the mineBlock method due to the changing nonce variable? Great videos by the way - I could follow and it's many years since I have written any JS :),0

"The transactions themselves are public/private key signed messages. The public key is your bitcoin address. The private key is what gives you ownership of the address. You can not make a fake transaction. You dont need blockchains to prevent that. What you do need blockchains for, is to make it impossible to re-order  or delete transactions, thereby letting you double spend.",0

Savjee good video bro. one question. when it comes to mining. does every node mine every block or only selected blocks and they all tie up together using hashes?,0
"Still mining 1 block with a difficulty of 10, it has taken more then 10 minutes :|",0
"Still doesn't make any sense.  What if a new node joins, is given a fresh copy of the ledger (by whom? we still don't know that yet), then the new node's power goes off for a week, and when it comes back on, the new ledger doesn't correspond with the old one, and all of the new blocks would be rejected.  The way it is explained here, the problem of unupdatable nodes would result in all transactions being rejected.   Obviously that's not the way it works, but if it isn't I'm still trying to find an explanation.  Something tells me I'm not going to find one because all of these cryptos are giant ponzi scheme scams!!!",0

On what device are you watching?,0
"When a transaction is added to a block, we don't have to keep it in the pending transactions. The code does this by redefining the pendingTransactions array",0
epoch is pronounced e-pock.,0
Blockchains run in a peer-to-peer network (like bittorrent for instance). If a node joins he simply downloads all the blocks in the chain from the other nodes on the network. When a node goes offline it's chain will be behind the others (correct!). When that node comes back online he'll perform a sync to get up to speed with what happened while he was away.   Please don't call something a 'ponzi scheme' when you don't know how it works. Ask questions and try to learn. Also how can a Blockchain be a ponzi scheme? They don't promise you big capital gains!,0
Everyone tries to mine the same block and stops if someone succeeds.,0

"In a""real blockchain"", does it really keep adding the mining reward to the pending transactions list; and then another miner has to mine that transaction? Wouldn't this create an endless cycle of rewards, which of cause keeps introducing new bitcoins to the system.

Savjee .. Thanks for the tutorial . One question though .. Imagine I have say I have large # of observers (say a billion) . Since we are using foreach loop to notify and its a O(n) operation ..by the time it reaches last observer another event happens the notify loop starts all over again.. how would we handle this scenario ? Let us say in environment like high frequency trading where trading happens in nanosecond time frames.. how can we handle this issue .. Thanks,0

"Hi, love ur explaination video, simple yet clear. But i am confuse on how those trading platform determine the price of a coin/token? How they make sure the price different between each exchanges? Or a coin/token need to have its own api on price to call or receive?",0
The price of tokens has nothing to do with how they work. It all depends on your decisions about when to enter the market.,0
Hmmm you will always have O(n) is this system. Nothing you can do about that. However you could make your observers asynchronous and distributed. Being async will allow you to quickly go through the foreach loop (since you don't have to wait for the return values). After that you spread the load among a number of computers who all work on handling a part of the observers.,0

"This was a very interesting video!  Their usage of multiple CPUs for redundancy is very clever, but I wonder how they manage to keep performance at optimum levels. Given that split second decisions can have a huge impact on the results. Your comment about game developers might contribute to this - they similarly have to write code that has consistent performance characteristics, you don’t want something that normally takes 5ms taking 100ms because it encountered a worst-case scenario. The choice of OS and language also contributes to this - a garbage collector or JIT compiler wouldn’t provide nearly the consistency they would need. I find it amazing that they can even spare the time to compare the results between CPUs, especially given that they likely have the CPUs spread out to provide extra redundancy, further increasing latency. That said, maybe the latency is so large that it outweighs any gains that could be made from increased performance.  In summary - they face very interesting challenges, and it’s cool to hear about it.",0
"it's a nice and really simple example. but my question is: just like the case in this example, the product team need the money to produce their product, and the the goal is the the final output product. is this a chicken-egg example? haha.  i think smart contract is useful for many scenarios like support servicess, logistics... etc which are  delay payment  required.",0
"great stuff, best vid yet. glad I am subscribed",0
"This video is mostly correct.

"Yes to both. If someone obtains your private keys, you are screwed. Which is why its so important to learn how to secure them, and why in practice for non trivial sums, you want to use a hardware wallet, like a trezor or ledger. These are USB devices which store the keys on a physical device that can not be tampered with via software. The private keys never leave the device. You can ask these devices to sign a transaction (after you enter the pin code, verify the address and amount on the screen) and you can broadcast that signed transaction to do a payment. But the private keys never leave the device and cant be read or hacked. You can restore the keys from a deterministic seed phrase should you lose the devices or if it gets damaged or destroyed. Of course, that seed needs to be kept secure as well.",0

There are no incentives. If you want to create a new transaction you have to verify 2 other transactions. So the incentive is: you cannot create transactions unless you verify a few.   Double spending is preventing by requiring people to verify 2 other transactions for each new one. Additionally IOTA uses a coordinator which checks transactions and locks the Tangle at certain intervals.,0

"hoping for likes ,,,,  BTW u dont need multiple  paralell CPU for the CPU problem you just need one that does the same calculation 3 times. But still the CPU and the software can not know if a bit flip had happened. I see it as an impossible problem. RAM bit flips are worse cause radiation has much greater chance to affect the RAM since the content of the RAM is not accessed that frequently. IMHO as I said you dont need multiple CPU you just need to do the calc a couple of times instead.  And in this long time a strike on RAM is more likely.  Starman is not going to Mars after all.

Those cryptocurrencies are what they will always be. IOTA's reclaim is no different than that time millions of BTC were produced out of thin air--it's amazing what growing pains are forgotten and how IOTA, as BETA, is being compared to Bitcoin in its final stage--it's a double standard that has no basis in reality.

Your explanation of ITAR is a little off.,0
One and only question - does it use Javascript,0
It might! One of the sources said that the interface for Dragon 2 was using Chromium and node. Flight computer still C++ though. Don't now if that's still the case...,0
The tool I'm using has nothing to do with the visuals...,0
Btw. What did you use for the visuals?,0
Most of it is done in Keynote and some stuff in Sketch. Mac only I'm afraid.,0
"Sketch is supercool, and yeah, sad part is both are only for MacOS.",0
x86? 🙄they are still using 32 bit machines.,0
You sound Flemish,0
Watched this vid twice already... fascinating stuff!!,0
Awesome video!!,0
That might be correct 👌,0
I've been wondering this exact same thing. Thanks!,0
"Awesome video, great content and quality.  Got yourself a new subscriber.",0
Can you tell any more about the linux they use?  Is it a forked distro? Custom kernel? unix-like?,0
"The internal temperature isn't nearly as extreme as the temperature on the surface of the spacecraft. Also, they use processors with a wide temperature range, such as Vorago microcontrollers.",0
This sounds interesting. Could I get a source for that?,0
"Lorenzo Zamponi, you sound like you're referring to the bit where the two right computers vote out the wrong one.  That's been the way since at least the Space Shuttle.",0
Redundancy in terms of number of hardware is not new. Aircrafts have also redundance hardware and redundance software all from different vendors. At the end they must produce same outputs for same inputs.,0
"""game developers are usually a good fit for spaceX, because they're used to writing code that runs in environments where memory and processing power are constrained"". I didn't know SpaceX was hiring game developers from the 90's, because this is probably just false,or greatly exagerated for most of the game developers nowadays. No one would hire a game developer for this kind of work, if there's an EQUALLY GOOD embedded systems developer available as well.",0
"I thought it was going to be an rtos, but instead is linux?",0
"this isn't at all new, advanced or special technology. airplanes began using systems like that 20 years ago",0
Awesome video. Hopefully these Crypto educational videos will one day become more popular than crypto price prediction ones.,0
"This video could have been summed up in two words, Mechanical Jebediah.",0
"This off-the-shelf-plus-redundancy approach is how it should have been done all along.  But not only for CPU/RAM.  What about the cameras?  Instead of laughably outdated, low resolution JPGs coming from a multi-billion-dollar probe (Huygens, anyone?), send two _modern_ cameras up, _or_ at least send up both a space-hardened, outdated POS _and_ a modern camera.",0
just like blockchain,0
if goingToCrash:     dont(),0
"Should be worth noting that another reason for C++ is that it compiles to directly executable binaries, contrary to other popular languages (Java, JS, ...) that have to go through an interpreter. And in rocket science every nano second counts!",0
One of problem in space is crystal growth across solder joints and getting shorted therefore I bet they will not be buying processors from amazon. They must be using at least avionics grade x86 processors instead of RAD5500. Can you cite credible source ?. To go to mars they have to use radiation hardened powerPC for critical system.,0
Do you know what x86 CPU they use ?,0
DAVALL JOHNSON Hack SpaceX ?,0
Exactly the right amount of explanation I want as an engineer and a developer. Thank you. You certainly got a sub.,0
Heat is more of a problem most CPUs turn off at 100c.Also what happens when the battery runs out ?,0
Great job! Subscribed!,0
Almerinda Romeira probably with RT patches,0
Usually when someone says x86 its 64 bit,0
Came expecting you to explain how they managed to fool the masses with their shitty cgi. Left disappointed 😂,0
"x86 is everywhere, so is GCC :D",0
"No difference in languange (VHDL/Verilog) going from Rad- hard FPGA (Flash based) to consumer/industrial ones (RAM based). Sometimes the part number is similar too, just the suffix like -c, -i, -m, (commercial, industrial, mil spec). The temperature range is different between these though... One can also use SEU detection/correction logic cores to mitigate SEU issues. Yes, triple mode redundancy and lots and lots of Built-In Test circuitries not found in typical consumer products. Plus being subjected to the environmental extreme tests you have explained. Test until it breaks, then you know your design margin. :)  COTS, I think, is just philosophical word someone in management/Govt invented to possibly cut cost (or when business people not talking properly with engineers), literally, it's nearly impossible to buy something from amazon and that it will work in extreme env conditions or even meet these design requirements, without modification, or custom job, like it literally says, Commercially available (from amazon or best buy), Off the shelf (grab something from best buy). It still doesnt make sense when I came across this requirement then.",0
"anthonyhdean I don't know about that, mechjeb can't even follow its own directions on ascent",0
RavenBomb123 - I'd let this through code review! (provided the dont method was appropriately implemented),0
Lester Yocson - How is this like BlockChain?,0
"It's actually just part of space tradition, one which hasn't been discarded wholesale the way SpaceX did with space-hardened software/hardware.  SpaceX is equally guilty of it.  They use 480i (yes, circa 1990) cameras for all of their space footage, including the recent, supremely historical Falcon Heavy / Tesla Roadster launch.  Those cameras aren't used for longer than a few hours, so there is literally zero excuse.",0
Andrew Sorensen true dat tho...,0
MajSolo - but at that point you might as well just spread that 3x RAM across 3 CPUs for complete redundancy instead of purely software redundancy.,0
Lorenzo Zamponi - It's utterly different to the way blockchain checks work and this came decades earlier.,0
I’m willing to bet ADA is used for critical navigation.,0
Can my brain have a 'Bit Flip'?,0
"I have a hat with those three layers, the tinfoil on the outside is just for show. I haven't noticed any bit flips yet. Seriously, your comment is very interesting, thank you.",0
Great video. Always used to wonder about how SpaceX did this.,0
"Great video and many valuable comments as well.  Thank you, I subscribed & look forward to more.",0
"hi, nice video, just one correction, the vehicle exploded because the high deviation activated de auto-destruction sequence",0
True! Which was caused by the high stress on the vehicle.,0
"wow! great video... I'm a low level dev and by watching the last 2 videos, really got the concept and quick application. Cool!",0
Well said.,0
obviously spacex uses mechjeb,0
Fais des vidéos en français sous titre anglais gars ça sera plus simple pour toi,0
"It’d be intresting to see what GPS they use, because normal gps shuts down at certain hights and speeds",0
I don't speak French very well...,0
"Also in the vid, the index is still in your hash.",0
c'est moi ou t'as un accent français ?,0
C'est toi! Je suis néerlandophone ;),0
Yep. Corrected that on Github and mentioned it in the description.,0
SpaceX uses a piece of software called CVXGEN developed by a Ph.D. candidate and his advisor from Stanford.  They have an ASIC system built to solve convex optimization problems generated by the various sensors and telemetry generated by the rocket -- all self sustained.  If you google Lars Blackmore you can find some of his published research papers on the topic.,1
"Simply Explained - Savjee au temps pour moi ^^ Sinon excellente vidéo, je découvre ta chaine et je pense avoir trouvé l'Eldorado :)",0
"I got the same error, where did you enter the wrong datatype?",0
Thank you very much for the info!,0
"The Dragon capsule has solar panels, so its battery will not run out for the mission duration. And for F9 and FH, they calculate the comsumption for the entire flight and put even more batteries as needed for backup.",0
"It’s obvious,they use mechjeb",0
Learned a lot. Subed!,0
"Why don't we use poll SCM functionality, it's also the same thing right ??",0
"Great video, very informative! Have a nice day.",0
What do you use to make videos like this?,0
"I see that this video is a massive success for you,e.g 100K+views in 3 days! I hope it helps you grow your channel in the long run.",0
7:6 when you tap on screen and see penguin crying!😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭,0
Would they benefit from using an Octacore AMD processor? 8x3= MOAR POWER,0
"is this series go on? like ""how to create a wallet"" or synch with clients? :)",0
It can be voted online with blockchain,0
Honestly blockchain tech looks very pale compared to this.,0
I fucking love computer science.,0
"My guess is something that's been modified a bit and the kernel has been built without any driver they don't need. I wouldn't be surprised if they just put the program in the initrd, so it executes as soon as the kernel is ready. It's fairly common practice to other Linux based embedded systems. Routers are a good example of that.",0
Does Space X use any internal databases or is all of that based out of ground based connectivity?,0
Wow this video game me aids.,0
"I don't understand one thing. Space X is a private company then from where did they get all the rocket technologies like manufacturing techniques, cryogenic technology as all of this high level tech is controlled by government. As many other countries are still struggling to do that inspite of all the support from government and money.  And can Space X sell their technology to other countries.",0
"Total COUNT of processors, not total AMOUNT of processors!",0
"FYI, the rocket technology isn't classified, it is export controlled. There is a fairly large difference between the two.",0
goog job and thank you from Makkah :-),0
"If you are only looking up with a and c, you can make the hashkey, 'a' concatenated with 'c'",0
"Thanks, I learned a lot from this and will consider some of these strategies in my development.",0
"In the Arianne 5, why did it try to put a 64bit number into a 16bit address?",0
"Awesome Vid. Makes so much more sense to have cheaper redundancy than rad hardened components. Never knew that they scaled the redundancy to each engine! SpaceX has also started to use bazel integration tools rather than their own custom build tools, furthering their interest in open source projects",0
The video needs better-quality audio. Better microphone?,0
This is a great video. Well explained and very informative!,0
"Question, so since radiation rays can change the binary code in the processing systems (sorry if this isnt the correct terminology), what would happen if Quantum Computing became a normal way of processing? would a Quantum Computer be affected by radiation at all? Is Quantum Computing necessary for deep space travel?",0
Guess I need to learn C++ and Linux in my spare time,0
"Cool tool btw. One thing, it's really annoying to confuse between ""git init"" and ""git ftp init"". since ""git init"" only doing initialization to the repository but ""git ftp init"" doing initialization and also at the same time push the code-files to the server.",0
Thanks for sharing. I love C++ too :),0
This was a bit too simplified imo. Simply explained doesn't necessarily entail that every single detail gets lost.,0
"Aariane 5 didn't break up it was detonated on purpose, i'm pretty sure I read about it in one of my boring cardboard textbooks.",0
how does validation of the latest update work?,0
Not using Microsoft windows as system? why?  hahaha,0
"Thanks a lot. Very helpful. Good video to start with when learning blockchain technology, and narration is good too. The BASICS seem SIMPLE; build a constructor and hash it then, link each instance like nodes, loop through the nodes, do some logical statements for validations, have the chain stored on local computers, and there you have it. I think. Please let me know.",0
"Thanx  a lot , cheers from Brasil .",0
"Hello this is very interesting, Im wondering where to go to learn about programming software like spacex automatic flight control for spacecraft, ive trying googling about autopilot programming but there are no resources of information regarding this subject, THANKS",0
Gotta love SpaceX. Looking forward to the launch this week,0
"Spoiler alert.....he is mostly referring to what Space X used back in 2012. So if 6 year outdated information is your thing, watch it all.",0
Well done video. Thanks,0
"Really great first half of the video, the code example finally made it click for me, thanks so much. But why did you not make a similar example for spectre? Video is missing some depth at the end",0
"Hi, Thx for sharing, very good video.  Is it very complex to take the block data from a cloud and put it to the chain?  My project:  - read nfc tag with arduino - put this data in the cloud ------------------------------------------- - take this data from the cloud and put it to the chain -------------------------------------------  I'm not a dev. I try to combine the topics IoT and Blockchain for a student project. I only want to demonstrate how it could work. Without thinking about security and real implementation.  If it's to complex to take the data from the cloud, maybe it's better to take the data from a file?  Like I said, it's only for demonstrating purpose.  Thx",0
I remembered a news story about off-the-shelf hardware in the 90s. Irans or Iraqs spies bought a lot of ps1 consoles then turned them into scud missiles processor guidance system. The US immediately put an embargo on ps1 sales. Good times. Nowadays its not weird to find milspec hardware using your average laptop/desktop cpu. Good times we're living now. Good and cheap.,0
Glad my cs department teaches c++ haha,0
Cool,0
"The video is great but what about bitcoin regulation. What stops bitcoin owners from speculation in the cryptocurrencies market? For instance, someone has a large amount of bitcoin, and by large I mean extremely large for all market. What stops him from creating fake transactions to make it look like there's a huge demand from buyers? All transactions are anonymous, no one knows who's selling and who's buying. So he can just speculate to make a false impression of huge demand and there's nothing to stop it. Are there any tools in blockchain to make it impossible?",0
"great videos, thanks",0

Hi and thank you for the tutorial! Why did you use sudo?,0
MyAtomicboy to prevent in the middle of launch the computers restart to install latest update 😌,0
"so if the blockchain isnt  received by others, the transaction wont be able to complete?",0
Can u plz explain digital signature,0
If u calculate 1 number number wrong and use that as a base number for other calculations it can have a huge impact!,0
Nice vid. I'd love to know how they program things like the pitch and yaw control modules used during launch. That architecture diagram must be massive! Hundreds of classes I'd guess.,0
"@Simply Explained - Savjee Great video!  What I would like to point is there is sometimes a strange low frequency noise in the audio, most noticeably appearing at 4:20  Good, professional content however!",0
What is described in the video involves enormous energy consumption. I think it's the most terrible aspect of this technology.,0
Great job! I'm just going through Bitcoin's whitepaper and this video helped me a lot with understanding the mechanism behind bitcoin transactions. Thank you!,0
"I do not understand anything about coding, but the way this mysterious gentleman stated everything, I was completely hooked up seconds by seconds till the end. I guess some peoples do have some extraordinary quality of teaching. Thanks Savjee",0

"I have been thinking a lot about this, and your video was really great at explaining everything. Much appreciated! 🙏🏾",0
Brilliant professional video. Love the graphics!,0
"Damn, what a brilliant little series! This is so very illustrative! Thank you!",0
"What a cool video, I love the detail on what makes space x different not just in a general sense but in a specific sense like this.",0
"Honestly I question whether they actually run Linux close to the hardware. I'm willing to bet they use VxWorks down on the bare metal hardware, and maybe Linux is running more of a supervisor role.",0
"I feel like the answer to the actual classified software is just   PID Control.  I mean, lets be honest, that's probably most of it.",0
"I wonder if that kind of multi-core error checking is coming (though I doubt it would be really necessary for every day desktop programs) with the sheer number of cores we're seeing.  There's still very few programs that use all the cores we have at our disposal, so it'd be interesting if all of the spare ones that aren't doing anything would just double up the calculations and serve as error-checkers.  The new Ryzen goes from 5 cores up to 16, I think.  Think of all those wasted clock cycles!",0

"Sudarshan, SpaceX is a service company only. They don't sell technology. NASA has been Very helpful to all U.S. aerospace companies, including SpaceX.",0
The point was made in the video that radiation hardening is only protection to a degree; it is not absolute. The advantages of redundancy are so great that SpaceX has rejected radiation hardening.,0
"Triple CPU redundancy was used in the 1960s in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. It is pretty much a common sense approach to space flight control. Nonetheless, enjoyed the presentation, thank you for sharing.",0

Did he land twin rockets and give the software away to Open Source? God must love Elon.,0
"not as mature as c++, way fewer developers.",0
Surprised that they used Linux.  I expected them to use a real time operating system.,0
"JavaScript, as one of their main criteria is language popularity. Seriously though, I hope they have look at the Rust programming language. It's just as fast as C++ but much more reliable. Unlike C++, Rust actually takes advantage of the past 50 years of advancements made in computer science research and practice. C++ may be popular but it's a terrible language for safety critical systems. To use it for the flight control system I can only presume that they must have spent a great deal of money on static analysis software and have huge team of testers.",0
"Incredible video, well done. Subscribed too :)",0
Excellent explanation for the lay person.,0
You're talking about electronics.  Software doesn't mind temperature or radiation  :),0
thank you guys for your comments and indepth explanations!!!,0
Very good snitzel yes,0
they used Ariane 4's software. Obviously the 2 rockets are very different so the software had to crash at some point...,0

"ok I'm,e done with you your inability to understand basic science and physics means that whatever i show you - you will reject it - so i am going to move on to someone who wants to ask serious questions and  genuinely wants to know - but by all means use the internet to contact amateur astronomers about the car - there are lots of them - and i hope you get to a place where you do start to understand the complexity of rocketry and space exploration.",0
"This explanation is so solid! Like others said in the comments, this is what made me get it. I sortoff knew but this made the click and will make it much easier for me to explain it myself in the future. Thanks!",0

Possibly.,0
"Brian Reilly The ground footage is 1080p or similar.  The onboard footage -- main booster, side boosters, and every angle on the Roadster payload -- is 480i, full stop.  The digital resolution of Youtube's video has no bearing on that.  If you're not familiar enough with broadcast NTSC to recognize it at a glance, do this: Capture an image from one of the Roadster feeds (like one showing the ""Don't Panic"" screen).  Paste it into Photoshop.  Scale it down to 480p.  Scale it back up to its original size.  Directly compare this result to the image before you did any scaling.  It should be bluntly obvious then.",0

"How the crypto currency would deal with banks and govenments who wants to know about where the coins comes from? I think this is the big deal.

And there are no digital instruments for the government's agencies to check that information if needed. Until digital currencies resolve that problem, nobody (banks and governments) will trust them.",0

"It is not my claim that makes no sense -- I am merely pointing out the obvious.  It is SpaceX's decision to use outdated cameras that baffles; on that point we are in complete agreement.  My guess, as I previously stated, is that it is just part of space tradition to use such cameras.",0

"Blockchain - Another  HUGE  HOAX!  Complete utter hogwash! But proves that BS , still baffles brains.   The key to this massive hoax is, firstly, revealed at the point of data capture; in terms of the nature of information or transactions being collected in each block. Irrespective of any value-audit at the point of data capture, everyone knows, that the value of any information or transaction; anywhere on this planet is constantly changing ,-  in fact, the laws of thermodynamics  support the reality of physical and abstract value fluidity in the universe and on this planet, largely because;  on  a whole, it is moving towards chaos, or for that matter, a ZERO VALUE condition under the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, the value audit is only meaningful at the point of initial data capture.  ""If it is too good to be true; it probably is... '    Leading to another massive hole in this  concept, in that there is also  nothing in this technology that provides an on-going optic or measurement of the transaction or information values collected, in any of the chained blocks within the chain (i.e. there is no innate or inside the block  value thermometer) beyond the point of data capture - so by the time you go to open the block, some decades from now, you will most likely find that there is actually little or nothing of value there - which should come as no surprise to anyone, because we live on a finite planet that is of less aggregate value with each passing moment, as its non-renewable resources are being concurrently depleted with growing populations. The opened empty block  would hence, conform as expected, with both the laws of the universe and noted planetary constraints.  In other words, you would have to insanely stupid to think that you can defeat the physical laws and constraints of the universe with the high technology of mere snake-oil semantics and mathematics, combined with zealous  criminal propaganda, seeking bigger fools happy  to buy the next voodoo tulip bulb you create for sale to a naive public.   So as Shakespeare once prolifically remarked, ""A fraud by any other name; would still be a blockchain"" Hmm...  --",1
"So 'difficulty' is just just to add delay in mining / adding new blocks. And it is to discourage spammers wanting to clog / tamper our Blockchain? But wasn't Blockchain distributed , and with mechanism to identify tampered block using consenses ?  Making code slow, isn't the smartest thing, I would imagine.  I think it's just to make miners feel that they have 'earned' it & deserve it.",0
omg! c++ i bet they use megatons of guidelines,0
very well explained for me than,0
"Basically, Bitcoin Cash provides an alternative to the changes made on the Bitcoin project. You can't deny Roger (and many others) has a point on not being happy with the direction, BTC is now facing.  He didn't even invent BCH, (what most of you do not seem to know), he just hopped on the chain he thought to be better. And all he is doing is emphasising on why BCH, as the original p2p cash system has more utility and therefore ultimately is the better (or only) store of value.   You can bitch all you want about Rogers personality, but remember: None of you and all the other BCH haters come off any way less unlikeable, than a triggered Ver. BCH remains nothing but an alternative Bitcoin Chain, that delivers to the needs of the people wanting it to be used as p2p cash without complex to implement solutions like LN. Since BTC didn't deliver still up to this day and you guys could care less, why would anyone even care?  Because ""Bitcoin Cash stole the Brandname?"". Is this now the only argument, next to ""BCASH-BCASH-BCASH"" you guys can come up with? You guys want to tell me you care for the people, that want to buy BTC but buy BCH instead? crocodile tears, i tell you.  and if bitcoin cash would be called B-token anyone would be happy with that altcoin and support roger in his cause to bank the unbanked? highly doubt it.",0
buy it . its cheap now,0
"Cool, are you able to give some comments to how the SpaceX software approach is different from how you worked? E.g. did you use C/C++, continuous integration, store logs with source code, test on actual hardware etc as mentioned here? I believe I read somewhere that SpaceX built a board with all the various hardware components, actuators etc controlled by the computers, so that they could test the software against actual hardware.  However that sounded like a no brainer to me. Would not all space companies do this? Or was your software only really tested upon launch of a rocket?",0
"Interesting video, but I wish you or somebody else could contrast with what is common in the rest of the space industry. It is hard to grasp the significance of what SpaceX is doing, if you have no idea what the other guys do. Here are some of the questions I wish somebody could answer: 1. What are the most common programming languages in the space industry and does language choice vary a lot with system it is used for? 2. Do other space companies NOT test code continuously against actual hardware? What procedure do they use then to test against real hardware? On launch site, once a blue moon?",0

"Hello Savjee,  Q1: Do you know if the SSL certificates issued through Amazon expire? For example, Letsencrypt certificates will auto-renew every 3 months,  as long as you have a shell script written and deployed that takes care of the renewal. Q2: Are the SSL certificates issued by Amazon good forever, or do you have to renew them within a specified amount of time? Thanks",0

"Hi Savjee!  I would like to ask you something: when exactly does a Blockchain block close? we say average 10 mins, but what is the trigger that no more transactions are to be included in a specific block? Thank you!",0
"All that can be shown is pictures of the idea of a block chain but never the source code behind the block chain; therefore, we are suppose to just trust someone when they say ""block chain"". And that is why all crypto currencies are pump and dumps and sadly people don't understand source code and will not believe me. Just tell people that Bitcoin is a mathematically protected digital currency and they will have trust and will send all their money.",0

According to studies, SPARK has orders of magnitude less errors per thousand lines of code (kloc) when compared to C. C++ is more complex than C and depending on their processes, it could have a higher risk of defects. C++ is not what I would imagine would be used for real-time safety-critical control systems.",0

"I think smartcontracts, the way it is explained here is only really good for true/false scenarioes. (yes / no scenarioes). In many of the examples there is more complex matters and shades of gray. I agree with you that these case still require 3rd party / human judgement. I am also of the oppinion that a blockchain of people sitting behind a computer will in no way be able to judge what actually happened in more complex examples. I.e I had a leak in my house, I claim to my insurance etc. Insurance company says I have not done my roof right or maintained it well enough to qualify. We have a disagreement. How will a blockchain judge who is right?? This is where qualified 3rd party surveyors come in, but it still becommes a matter of a human being, and his bias what decision is reached.",0

"I hear you. If I may share further. Where I live, V for Vendatta is a primary symbol of people power against a kleptocracy (1MDB scandal).

Those hackers who hack with ill intent perhaps should be associated with a Guy Fawkes mask with horns and a devil's tail as opposed to the Guy Fawkes mask popularised by V for Vendetta.

"Hi Savjee, but why not instead of leaving the balance of the miner to the next block you can't auto insert this transaction into the pending transactions plus setting a new property called ""minedBy"" to show that the miner really put some efforts into the mining?  With this you can ensure that the token will be ""instantly"" transfered and anyone that can check the chain can build correctly the miners balance.",0

"actually, yes, people do either write or adopt compilers for special hardware, it's neither uncommon nor unfeasible. there are at least 30 different c++ compilers out there, many of them for specialized hardware.   (eg checkout visualdsp++). you think they come out of thin air?   it's not necessary that spacex would write their own compiler, but say they use a special ""space processor"", it is likely that it'll come with an exotic compiler/linker/optimizier. again, this means fewer developers have deep knowledge of the toolchain, which can cost time. by using x86 and a standard gcc toolchain, every c++ developer can immediately go to work. (you know, like the video explains it, if you had listened)  there is also one thing which i believe wasn't mentioned: every compiler has bugs. the more users a compiler has, the less bugs it will have. again, this makes gcc+x86 a strong choice.",0

Great video. Thank you!,0
"You correctly implement the proof of work in the mining function, however, it is not enforced in the isChainValid() function. This means that block tampering attack can still be easily mounted by re-computing hashes of the victim block and all blocks afterwards.  In such an attack, the difficulty can be ignored and the chain will still be valid since you don't check whether each hash actually has the right number of preceding zeroes.  I proposed the necessary change on your GitHub repository. Cheers :)",0

Space travel has unique problems almost requiring out of date software and hardware. The space shuttles last flight in 2011 had hardware and software that was state of the art in 1992!

"There are huge differences between currrency and cryptocurrency: currency is government approved and backed while crypto is not. Goverment (or FED in USA) controls money supply, and it almost guarantees its value by controlling money supply when necessary. So owning the dollar is like owning the government and its economy: government promises its value and their economy always have demand. No wonder most stable and richest economies currencies, like USD and YEN, is most sought after currencies, in contrast zimbabwe currency.  On the other hand, bitcoin is controlled by no one. That is bad thing because its value is not protected. Because of this, bitcoin fails to meet definition of currency: it must be a store of value. As you can see, no one can stop this outrageous price volatility and no one will accept this as a currency that can drop 20-30% of its value within a day.",0

The centralization of mining pools isn't actual centralization because individual miners are free to leave any time. This is not a centralization threat. The power issue can't be viewed in a vacuum and one must consider the power that us not used because the transactions are happening elsewhere. There are places for both PoW and PoS. It's not as simple as this video makes it out to be.,0
"seems to me that benefit has to be linear, or over-linear, with stake, if it's isn't people just register lots of small stakes.",0
thanks. keep the vids coming,0
Country Corner but miners would immediately disconnect from the pool.  Miners get paid in coins/tokens. Do you think they are going to expend energy to mine something that would immediately become worthless upon a 51% attack? The only way a pool could pull this off is if they owned every miner that was connected and even then they would only be able to maybe falsify one block. The amount of work to falsify 2 or 3 especially in a network like bitcoin is impossible even if pools coordinated an attack.,0
"As always, awesome!",0
Great tutorial. Would you mind telling me what tool you used to create these videos,0
How do you know if you are validating a fraudulent transaction? How can miners/validators avoid that kind of scenario? Cheers. Great video.,0

"Great summary. I also run a channel that specialises in blockchain technology.  For me Proof of Work is a subsidiary of Proof of Stake.  Both require you to stake something; in the POW it is electricity and subsequently FIAT money. In POS, it is the cryptocurrency.  Regarding the 51% attack, miner would in reality need somewhere around 65%, 51% would make the attack ""possible"" but still highly unlikely. Plus, once the network sees what you are doing, they will kick you out and reduce the damages that you have made. In reality, if you invest enough money to initiate a 51% attack, you soon realise that you could use this to make more money, if you use it to secure the network",0

Think of the countries that don't even have a strong form (or any) central banks or where there is government corruption. Cryptocurrencies would aid those individuals out of corruption within their own country. Also, those places that don't have internet yet are behind in innovation and will get left in the dust by 1st world countries. They have no influence in the progression of cryptocurrency. Their focus should be on getting the internet live.",0

"I am curious about the following use case:  Let's say I am visiting a city for the day and decide to buy a coffee from Coffeeshop. I know that I will only order one coffee since I do not live there, so I pay using the lightning network, opening up a payment channel with Coffeeshop. Since I am only visiting, I decide to close the payment channel directly after the transaction takes place.  I understand that the transaction would be instant using the lightning network (correct me if I am wrong), but would I not have to pay the same transaction fee for the one coffee using the lightning network as I would using the Bitcoin network directly?  I can see where the lightning network would benefit multiple purchases through one vendor, but I am having a difficult time understanding the value for the one-time transaction use case mentioned above.

So what stops fake or otherwise false data getting into the blockchain in the first place? Can blockchain be used to launder things?

Your average user doesn't know their hash from their bash.,0

Falcon itself runs on PPC based controllers which are also used for low levels functions on Dragon the X86 computers don't directly control the vehicle it's kinda like a horse and rider arrangement.

I think the lowest end hardware they use is automotive quality stuff which is still very ruggedized compared to lets say a laptop or phone.,0
Real time control systems need to have repeatable deterministic behavior and you';re not going to get that with an interpreter.,0
Please explain private blockchain like Monero or Dash! Thanks!,0
when i try changing the index to 2 or 3 it becomes true true instead of true false?why is that so?,0
and after i add in the formula for recalculating the hash it shows true true again isntead of true false...,0

Savjee next video should be about delegated proof of stake,0
"Keep up the good work mate, it was informative.",0
"Nice video! I have a question: what about saving each password with its encrypted version, using the password itself as encryption key? This way each stored password would have a unique encryption key, instead of a single AES key shared among all the saved passwords.",0
Could you make a video implementing proof of stake as well? I have been able to find absolutely zero examples online outside of scholarly work. I'm a visual learner so I need to see it to understand it.,0
"There are several inaccuracies in this video. First of all, the Ariane V did not crash because of an invalid cast from 64 to 16 bit, the overflow was in an unused software component that had been carried over from the Ariane 4 and would normally have done nothing. The reason why the rocket failed was because the overflow caused an uncaught exception to be thrown. TLDR exceptions were a terrible idea.  Another error is the use of linux at spacex. Linux is completely unsuitable for hard real-time applications because among other things it does not have an execution time upper bound on its scheduler. Linux is used on desktop computers but not on the actual rocket. The computers on the rocket either run off-the shelf RTOS's, or they run their software on bare metal without any OS.",0
The ariane 5 bug was indeed wrongly described. There is a comment here that specifies exactly what happened (a bit different from what you say)  As for Linux: check my sources. They really use it on their spacecraft.,0
dont forget to salt it.,0

Nice video man.,0
It's very nice video.. thanks for your efforts and keep it going,0
wow that just to much work needs to be simple for it to go mainstream,0
"bCrypt is simply a much slower hashing algorithm.  It, like MD5, can still be hacked if your password is weak... it just takes longer.",0
Where/how do you store the salt and cost do you can use it when the user tries to log in?,0
"Thank you for such a great explanation! I'd also like to know, how do you make your videos? They seem soo flawless! Do you use a certain app?",0
Excellent work,0
"You can store the salt in your database with the hashed password. And if you're using bcrypt, the hash, salt and cost are all in 1 string.",0
Simply Explained - Savjee Thanks. If I store the salt in the database (the same one that a hacker just got access to) how is that secure?,0
It just ensures that each hash is unique and that cracking attempts can't be speeded up with tricks like rainbow tables.,0
"So you didn't shared any info about internal design, and just shared how literally any company working nowdays.",0

This video explains what a Blockchain is at a basic level. Not its potential or limitations. Blockchain is useful on a very small network with limited data structural needs.,0
Litecoin is introducing smart contracts,0
"My understanding was that in order for a transaction to go through a node in the first place, it must ""have liquidity"". Supposedly, only banks would have such a liquidity.",0
But it looks like the solution to the scaling problem is to enable middle men to do some processing (i.e. banks).,0
"So, you must sign up with the ""counterparty"" in advance before buying/purchasing goods and services? You could not just walk in and pay (like you do now with Visa and cash) right? When a channel is first opened, that could take a long time -  (since it has to register with the main Blockchain which runs at 7 trns/sec).",0
You might want to use those other funds to do something like - um - pay other bills?,0
"This was not mentioned as part of the video. So, when opening the channel, it is more like opening a Bar Tab. I would not think that Starbucks would make many coffees for Bob if they were not getting paid for each coffee made. It makes sense that the banks would pay Starbucks for each coffee made (if they are acting as the node). If the channel is closed, then the bank gets to keep the money that is in escrow?  If the bank is paying for Bob's coffee, then would not the bank charge extra for making the payment?",0
"It is my understanding that if Bob creates many transactions - ex: 200 - with Starbucks (i.e. buys 200coffees), Starbucks will only get paid after the channel closes.  So, at $6 per coffee, will Starbucks be OK with being out $1200?",0
"Is this figure based upon a certain number of working nodes? If so, how many?",0
"So, in order for this to work, one MUST have a node. There is no client software that could be used instead?",0
"to do that, you need a quantum level of computing. as the video said it is almost impossible to tamper.",0
How can FinCEN (an American Entity) control what happens in Russia or  China?,0
Juan Lespins- my understanding is that Bitcoin is being used all over the world. How is it that an American company can try to regulate issues that are associated with different countries?,0
"Great video. Congratulations. I have a question though, in the example, I tried to tamper data and did recalculation of current hash and assigned to existing hash. I got output as true. We are not tampering anything with previous block hash. Basically I have not understand the check on current block hash with the previous block hash as for me it always return true.  Also if I carefully watch video , when you do a tampering and set current hash. It gives output as false. However if I examine your console which is on this video, both previous hash and current hash seems to be identical. Then how does it return false?  Thanks Matty",0
"Thank you very much a simple and beautiful explaination of blockchain in cryptographic currency, Savjee.",0

You explain very clearly. Can you do a video about new ICOs too? I'm interested specifically in SciDex.,0
"a type is more of an alias. So you can have a type *TransportationMethod = Train | Car | Bike;* , this makes it easier to declare a type on a variable. Instead of typing *let transportMethod: Train | Car | Bike = new TrainTransport();* you can type *let transportMethod: TransportationMethod = new CarTransport();* .  an interface gives you more flexibility with *extending* and *augmenting* . In the above example you could have the Train/Car/BikeTransport methods implement the TransportationMethod interface. You can then again say *let transportMethod: TransportationMethod = new BikeTransport();* .  Let's say you got a request from somebody to implement a Boat transport method. Once again you implement the BoatTransport using the TransportationMethod interface. Now everywhere where you assigned something of interface TransportationMethod you can also use the new BoatTransport. This would be akin to changing the type to TransportationMethod = Train | Car | Bike | Boat;. So in this case not really a big difference vs. types.  The big difference comes when later in your app development you decide to add a new feature; a routeplanner. You can now *augment* the TransportationMethod interface with a routePlanner() method.  You can also create a new interface called RoutePlanner and use that to *extend* the existing TransportationMethod interface using the *implements* feature.  So while types & interfaces share some aspects, interfaces give you a lot more flexibility and thus are generally preferred to types.",0
"Dear What I have understood till now is, if the person decides not to send the product, another party can go to the court and force him/her to deliver the product with the help of smart contract as it has recorded the transaction, now the only problem is, Blockchain smart contract should have legal status, which at present not by most of countries",0

"If you are building a web-project you can also implement the observer pattern with events. Assuming you use jquery, it's as simple as: 1. Trigger the event with *$('body').trigger('weatherStation:tempChange', newTemp)* 2. Listen to event triggers with *$('body').on('weatherStation:tempChange', (e, newTemp) => { // logic to handle newTemp})*  If you goto the Dev Tools you can see that youtube makes heavy use of custom events. In the Elements tab you can select an element, then see all the Event Listeners attached to it.",0

My only question is what if the first block (genesis block) is tampered with? By the explanation it seems that the first block can't be referenced by the other blocks.,0
I just watched the video I am glad someone else had the same question. I am hoping that someone can answer your question about the genesis block.,0
Seriously helpful video man! Seeing it implemented made blockchains so much easier to understand. I finally get why proof-of-work actually works and how it prevents and slows malicious modifications to the chain. Incredible work.,0

"Can you explain how luck factors into this for a miner?  If I understand correctly, the miner is simply changing the nonce until the block difficulty is met (please confirm if I'm incorrect here).  If so, wouldn't every miner start at nonce 0 and work up by 1 sequentially, therefore whoever has the most computing power would solve every block?  Or, is it more efficient to randomize the nonce?  Thanks for a great video series.",0

"With Bitcoin, this would be similar to two new blocks being mined at approximately the same time. There will be two valid chains until one of the chains is longer and is accepted by nodes as the authoritative chain representing the most work. With each block added onto the chain, the odds of the chains remaining the same in length exponentially decreases.",0
"That's the idea. If you want to cheat the system, you need to recalculate the entire blockchain beginning with the first block you tamper with. In Bitcoin,  you'd also have to solve the Proof of Work equation again, so you'd burn a ton of energy to re-create all those blocks (plus the new blocks being continuously added).",0
"If you want to cheat the system, you need to recalculate the entire blockchain beginning with the first block you tamper with. In this simple example, that is easy to do, as you point out. In Bitcoin,  you'd also have to solve the Proof of Work equation again, so you'd burn a ton of energy to re-create all those blocks (plus the new blocks being continuously added).",0
Yes. He's using visual studio code.,0
This is an extremely simplified version. But it's a step toward Bitcoin.,0
"When we talk about block chain being distributed and totally secure, one question that comes to my mind is. How do we validate a new person coming into the blockchain network to support with the computational power? and even if an attacker gets into the network by seeking himself as a legitimate one, he gets all the copies of blockchain till that period. Then, can't he send some malware to the distributed blockchain network and corrupt the entire network?  Just a thought....:)",0
what a rude answer!,0
"We don't have to trust anyone on the network. The nodes trust the consensus algorithm (proof of work for instance).  However your idea of using malware to change the Blockchain is interesting but won't work. If malware changes the contents of a block, a node still has to redo every block after it. That requires a ton of computer power and becomes impractical.",0
Yep,0
Excellent! You made Blockchain comprehensible for children,0
Nice Explanation.,0
What if someone after altering the data of the block hardcodes the old value of hash instead of calculating the hash value via SHA256 ? Will it work then???,0
This video is explained in a great way!,0
Wouldn't this mean that all data has to be stored by everyone? how does everyone have enough space to store all this data?,0
Cool Bro! May God Bless You!,0
"Thanks, the 2nd method with using API gateway console was only working to me. AWS interface is a little bit different now... but it works.",0
Yes that's true. Everyone has to store everything and for now that's still doable because storage is cheap and blockchains aren't super massive yet (can fit on a single harddrive). But in the long term it could become an issue.,0

Where would the store the salt for all the passwords. They don't store this salt then every time the passwords hashes will be different right? Do they hash the salt applied to a user's password or will they keep it encrypted with every user's email or something?,0
The block chain seems to have more uses than just Crypto.,0
Sudo is used to force the command to happen. It's typically used when you don't have the right permissions.,0
You just store the salt together with the hash of the password. No need for encryption or anything like that.,0
"Then its still easy to crack the password if they get both salt and hash r8? After cracking one password , I will apply the salted hash algorithm for all the hash and salt I have.",0
"The salt is there to prevent you from cracking multiple passwords at once. Imagine 5 users have the same password. If you don't use a salt, the hashes of these passwords will be the same. So if you crack 1, you instantly know the others as well. With a salt however you have to crack each one individually. They also protect against rainbow tables and dictionary attacks. It's not perfect, but helps! (Also look at bcrypt: they generate 1 hash that contains the salt in plain text) You really can store them together.",0

"Every time when some property of a Block has been changed, the hash of block should be changed too.  When we add the block, we tire the new block with the latest block on blockchain by pointing to the hash of previous block.  Since we change the value of some property of block, we should recalculate the hash too)",0
Great video! It would be neat if you could show a video of exactly this using a different method such as a doubly linked list since you are currently using an array to get data from the block.,0
But a Blockchain doesn't use a doubly linked list. Each block only contains a reference to the previous block.,0

You should also mention that encryption works in the other way too. An encrypted message with a private key can be decrypted only by the paired public key and this insures that the sender (or whoever encrypted the message) is indeed trusted.,0
taz0k2 yeah I still don't understand why he does it.   I get it that every time something in the block is changed then the hash must be recomputed. But isn't the blockchain built so that once the hash is validated it will always be the same?  Why isn't the only and final blockchain hash the one made from the winning miner?,0
It wasn't working with the email confirmation for me so I had to use DNS. Great video tho!,0

"Hash is used to show the validness of the block. If the hash is not valid, then the block is not valid too. Say, someone hacked the block.  Let's say, my block contains 1 bitcoin, and the hash is ""aaaa"". Now if we will change the amount of bitcoins in the block to 5 bitcoins, then ""aaa"" will be invalid.  After changing of property (1 bitcoin to 5 bitcoins), if we will re-calculate the hash, then we will create a new valid block with 5 bitcoins and hash that represents it ""bbb"". Otherwise our block will stay as a invalid block with 1 bitcoin.  When other blocks in the blockchain will connect to our block, they will use the hash to validate the validness of data inside of the block. Now they will use the hash to validate the block:)",0

You're genius dude,0
hii i am getting error while creating ssl kindly help,0
Thank you. If POS is really as secure then it's definitely the way to go vs POW consuming massive amounts of energy and ever increasing mining costs.,0
So what happens if someone illegaly uploads your nudes ? That's out there for potentially forever and unable to delete. How do you regulate that ?,0
You can't... There is a discussion ongoing about implementing blacklists but it would depend on the clients to respect those.,0
"0:49 ""national security security"" 😂",0
Pied Piper is too late to the party.,0
"What about privacy? How could you ensure that the files are private and that people that might store them can’t access them? Also, what happens when you want to delete a file? Will it remain available forever as long as people have the address to the file? Nowadays, once something is taken down, although someone might still keep a copy, it is kinda hard to efficiently distribute it. Would it be impossible to stop this using this system?",0
"And if a government could block a list of hash? I'm not an expert, but could this be a possible problem?",0
"Hi, don't you think the core objective of this is same as the 'Substratum' Project. Their project is already live (early beta). What do you think about it?  Thanks for making these videos.",0
Resume: Hashgraph is a proprietary peer to peer network that could delete any content from their blockchain if their partners were affected by the content the you put on it.  That is a big joke,0
awesome.... i'm an OOP developer... and i can finally understand blockchain by watching your videos... thanks!,0
"Yeah, it's not even a blockchain, more like a software simulated computer network, like you said, a peer to peer network.",0
Honestly this channel keeps you updated about all the cutting edge technology,0
"ShadPayback not sure exactly, but in theory you could store your private files encrypted, if the encryption is strong enough. You could only access them if you had the key.",0
IPFS sounds a lot like freenet.,0
Yes please! More videos like this and a video about Filecoin! I love it!,0
Why did you not mention the most promising IPFS project (EOS storage)?,0
"I’d be interested to know how they plan on accounting for illegal content like pirated videos etc. If you’re participating in something like Filecoin, how do you avoid inadvertently becoming host to something you didn’t want to? Also in your example of using the file hash to ensure no tampering was done to the file you’d still be downloading the content before being able to hash it so the nefarious user has still managed to get the content onto your system. Do they plan on providing some incentive against this? Maybe an intelligent blacklist on the client’s that would start to ignore content served from and ignore requests to serve other nodes that don’t play nicely? Eventually those nodes would be cut off from the network.  In any case, very interesting topic and well described (and animated)!",0
But what if I do not know the hash of the original file? How can I be sure what the correct hash should be if I have no idea what the original file looks like?,0
"I am sure the whole concept of distributed internet is so that you cannot delete/censor any file once it is out there. If you don't want people to have some file, store them on your own drive would be the better option. Once something is in the cloud, you should always assume it is shared with everyone.",0
Where is the code ?,0
Uhm... Did you even try looking for it?,0
That's where IPNS comes in. A sort of secure and distributed DNS-like system.,0
No reason.,0
"good video, and i want to learn delegate proof of stake and other consensus mechanism , thanks so much",0
"Under normal means it would be difficult. Imagine government cracking down bank accounts with corrupted money. Government needs to verify all the transactions (decrypt all the hashes). It takes alot of time and effort. But! If government can create an AI to do this job, this will become possible. (So far there is no AI that can  do this efficiently yet)",0
"LOL I was just googling ""DNS for hash""! Thank you for the quick response :)",0
Like others mention: it's indeed the goal og IPFS to work like this. Completely distributed and immutable. Not possible to delete a file (but it will probably disappear on its own because nodes will stop caching it when its not requested),0
Looks very similar yes. I just picked IPFS because it's already being used in the wild (Wikipedia Turkey & Dtube).,0
In theory IPFS could implement a blocklist (has been discussed) but it wouldn't be 100% effective. Nodes could chose to ignore them and share files anyway.,0
"Awesome content, waiting for filecoin",0
Awesome bro. Can you please teach how to setup ipfs in servers and how to fetch/store content programmatically . Thanks,0
Hey savjee are you belgian? You have a smight accent,0
"You were reffering to 256 kilobytes, yet your graphics shows kilobits. Which one is it then?",0
Bytes,0
I am yes!,0
I'm extremely interested in the IPFS. Can't wait to see it explode with growth. It would be good to see a way to host files with a currency other than filecoin.,0
"If I decide to fill a transactions with information like my name and the receivers name there is no way to stay anonymous after that, right?",0
"What about the real world application of IPFS? After all, this was just a theory. What about in practice? Honestly, I haven't checked anything but if I wanted to start using/contributing to IPFS network, how do I do that? Maybe make a part 2? :) Great stuff btw!",0
"Yes please, do a filecoin video!!!😁",0
"Can you make a video on the Oyster protocol? It takes a slightly different approach to the same goal of ifps, also adding volatile memory functionality. It is built on top of the  IOTA tangle so could potentially be distributed across all smart devices in the near future",0
The Wikipedia mirror and Dtube are both real world examples. You mean a tutorial on how to setup a node yourself right?,0
"No, but why would you want to do that?",0
"I have a question. Ideally, does a block contain multiple transactions or only one? if it's multiple, are the transaction grouped by certain parameter (e.g. contains transactions with the same fromAddress), or just random?",0
"it's not an error... at the first time mining, you processed those 2 initial transactions. you haven't got rewarded.... after 1st mining, you got a reward which is posted as ""pending"" transaction and it's not in the block yet. that's why you need to do 2nd mining to have it in the block.",0
Another Great Video... Becoming a huge fan now.. Looking forward to FileCoin video..Great Work,0
Isnt this similar to what HOLOchain is trying to do?,0
Yeah.. I believe content ownership is difficult target for all decentralized p2p file storage applications. The concept of ownership demands centralization.,0
"How do they limit who can add new versions of files? If all it takes is linking the new file to the old one, it seems like anyone could do that. That would be a problem for sites like Wikipedia that still want to exercise some editorial control, even over a distributed network.  Maybe anyone can add new versions but the versions are signed by the creator, and when requesting content you as the client could filter the versions to only show those made by the creator. Or if you *want* an unfiltered Wikipedia you could view all versions by anyone. A system like that would provide a nice compromise.",0
Upon doing some investigation it seems like I wasn’t too far off - by default links to a file are limited to whatever the state of the file was at the time that link was created. But as an alternative you can distribute your node’s name (which is a hash of a public key) and that name can be resolved to the latest version of a resource that you want to share. You can generate multiple node names (aka keys) if you have many resources that you want people to always have the latest version of.,0
what kind of softwarw do you use to make this animations?,0
"Yep, this is essentially IPNS. Anyone can create new versions of your file, but only you have the power to change your IPNS 'link'.",0
I don't understand why adding more 0 will make it more secure? can someone please help to explain it? thanks,0

getting error Process exited before completing request please help,0
amazing! please  video about filecoin :),0
yes u simply explained,0
Thank You! Very helpful!,0
"Savjee, your explanation is great. Thank you very much",0
"nice and simple vid. thanks. if you implicitly referred bitcoin data structure, hash of previous block is actually the hash of previous block header. and the hash in each block is the merkle root which is not the same as the ""previous hash"" going into the next block header. pretty sure you are aware and just want to simply things for explanation purpose. but want to point out anyways.",0
"try running your command with -vv option and check the logs. The reason could be anything. I had also faced issue and in my case it was due to the disabled support of SFTP in curl (7.47). You will get to know about that after checking logs. The comman should be like ""git ftp push -vv -u <<username>> --key <<key path>> sftp://<<server name>>/path""",0
Can you record a video teach us how to make a ipfs mining machine?,0
You cannot 'mine' IPFS.,0
"Simply Explained - Savjee but in China, some people are planning pre-selling ipfs mining or server machine which can act ipfs nodes and make filecoins, linux system, per TB hard disk matching 20Mpbs upload internet ability, how can they make it?",0
I meant that IPFS is not a mineable coin. Filecoin on the other hand is. So I wrongly understood your question. Unfortunately no video like that is planned.,0
"Simply Explained - Savjee if possible, please😁",0
"So it means that, if we will use Salt when making this hashes, it will be very hard - almost impossible to change data, to generate the same hash.",0
Nicely explained..after lots of searching I find this video most helpful,0
"So, is the node that creates the block with their proof of stake directly appending the block to the blockchain, or is there another consensus mechanism like the 51% mechanism that validates the new block after it is created and before it is appended to the blockchain?",0
superb point people do not get it!,0
How come you used class in JavaScript? Does JS support classes for object orientation?,0
Yep! Check es6!,0

"is savjeecoin  you personal information like and id, if so, would I have to put my own ""computer name"" in place of savjeecoin?",0
"wow, this is some top-notch explanation. I think it may even be at the point that you could use it to explain IPFS to an elderly person.",0
"""Bob"" doesn't have to create and fund a payment channel with the coffee shop, that would be insane. Imagine having to create different payment channels for every single store you shop at?   He can simply fund a few different payment channels that will allow him to route his transactions to the coffee shop by finding a path between these channels. You can basically fund these payment channels with however much it is you are willing to spend on LN transactions, and good old computer science will do the appropriate routing for you. That's what's so great about the LN.",0
This means Bob cannot buy Coffee from a shop of his choice. The transaction process will get complicated as more players and shops come so problem gets transfered elsewhere.,0

"You have to pay a short fee to create a contract through your wallet. In that contract, you can program the details of the transaction.",0
"Great video, but the difficulty isn't exactly the number of zeros required. The hash is a 64 character hexadecimal number that can be converted to a decimal number like 5. A block has a property called ""nonce"". The block then takes the data and the nonce and creates a hash. Meanwhile the blockchain system has a ""difficulty"" of 100 for example. The block will keep getting rehashed (and the nonce increases by 1 every time) until the hash (when converted to a 10-based number) is less than the difficulty.",0

"This is incredibly well explained, thanks a lot! I'm writing an article and I'm definitely linking this video as a source.",0
Nothing is perfect. Blockchains and smart contracts can indeed be cheated when you have a lot of computing power to throw at it. This is called the 51% attack and happens when a person or company controls more then 50% of the computing power on the network.,0
"Hi, I use concrete5 cms and I usually keep the core CMS (~35 MB & 5500+ files) in another repo since that will almost never change so I do not add to every repo that uses it.

"I disagree with that. Annotations are an implementation of the decorator pattern that comes with the language. In Vanilla JS and Python a Decorator is simply a function that takes as a parameter another function and uses the result of the latter before or after some other computation. In React JS for example, a very popular JS library, HOC are essentially decorators. Annotations are a feature of the language that allows you to write @whatever instead of whatever(f). But, in Typescript there's also more. You have actually object descriptors and reflection that you can use.",0

"Most of these applications, can't they just use a traditional database? For example, with the odometer reading, why wouldn't the government just store this information against all the existing information they have about each car (eg. Registration data)?",0
great video... thank you for the explanation. what program do you use to create videos like this?,0
The Angriest Puppy look up PoS. New way to mine and new blocks are minted from people who hold the coin so they are more invested in it. Similiar to a dividend. No gfx card required.,0

Every example already has solutions that are either cheaper or good enough.,0
POS doesn't solve the issue of a non-monetary transaction system. It is infeasible pay a fee every time to transact data on logistical information such as location of a container.  In practicality these solutions will be implemented through a DAG or other form of fee-less distributed consensus architecture. For example If IOTA implement smart contracts to their tangle this creates a far more practical environment for distributed consensus.,0
Nice video 😉,0
Seems blockchain is for creators,0
Please can to made new videos about smart contracts thanks bro regards from Colombia sud-America,0
"I have a problem with so many coins for the same thing (for example the ones to make payments). I have the feeling can only be one winner at the end, because what is the sense of having more than one payment method? so this is a war between all these coins? or they can coexist (how)?",0
I liked the idea of smart contracts,0
@Trader of Future: Care to elaborate on the cheaper solution? Voting one would be revolutionary imho.,0
"The issue with traditional databases are that they are centralized, which are prone to attacks. Blockchain solves this issue by making your applications decentralized.",0
"Like others have pointed out: blockchains solve the 'trust' problem. Traditional databases can do everything that Blockchains can, but can you trust the ones managing them? Also: they are usually not open and transparent. Blockchains are.",0
"This can also be solved with technology. We could put RFID stickers on each shipment and read them once they enter the facility. Also tracking richt now is pretty reliable, no? Packages just go on a conveyor belt and are automatically scanned and tracked.",0
Yeah pipelines are great but often confusing.. I'll look into it!,0
"They mostly add that element to raise money and to give an incentive for people to join and secure their network. Could make for a next video, yes! Thx!",0
I'll think about! Thanks!,0
I think they can coexist because they all have different purposes. They all make sense in their own network. The only thing we need is interoperability between them. The ability to quickly exchange coins in a decentralized way. Also: in the real world their are multiple currencies. That could also be the future of crypto ;),0
Simply Explained - Savjee yes but in real world there are multiple coins because every country has its own. Crypto are global. So why paying sometimes in btc and sometimes in ada? What is the advantage of that?,0
Education,0
"Just make the hashing much much easier (and if possible, not hugely increase in difficulty like currencies do) so it can be done quickly on mainstream computers, the client program can check to see if the client's computer is powerful enough, and switch to a backup no-mining mode if it isn't - whether or not it downloads the blockchain could be based on a download speed test (if not fast enough it logs in to a server if not, and there will be local servers for each area of the country so that the blockchain is spread out across multiple servers. Private companies with secure servers or universities (since they're spread out across the country already) could be paid to be hosts for this).  I don't know if blockchain inherently requires a large increase in difficulty as time goes on, or if that's a feature built into currencies to control inflation.",0
I love this channel and i have made a research paper and it was a primary source to know about blockchain,0
Will there be more videos to this series ?,0
Great vid as always. And how can those blockchains communicate and transfer data with each other? Through interoperability. Like the XRouter from Blocknet. Would love a explanation video about that.,0
Simply Explained - Savjee I guess that makes sense... hmm. A video on it would still be helpful if you want to.,0
"Regarding the odometer fraud, Why does this warrant the use of blockchain, why cant government collect the data using the device you mentioned and save it in their own database(any traditional one)? and make public APIs availbl to query this DB so people can know it themselves",0
Please make a series on making a wallet for our cryptocurrency,0
There's a link to a video that explains exactly that at the end of this video,0
"I have a question about this. Everybody say that blockchains are open and can data saved can be consulted. But that's not the case, a company can easily encrypt the data they write on a blockchain. Or even make it available in it's network.  Blockchains are not open but a new way of storing data that ensure it's authenticity",0
Can you guide me through on how to start a cryptocurrency coin?,0
"No, I can't. Sorry!",0
"A Blockchain is a linked list and doesn't mean much unless you specify: - is it private or public, permissioned or permissionless? (in case of private and permissioned a DB is always a better choice) - what is the consensus mechanism? - who are validators? - does it represents a digital asset that ""lives"" inside the blockchain or is it a representation of an external asset? in this last case how do you manage counterparty risk? If you answer these questions you'll see that some of your examples are not realistic",0
Yes they can choose to encrypt their data although it has to make sense for the use case that you want to apply Blockchain to.,0
What Visual studio code do you have? I cant download the NMP Install --save Crypto.js Cant download the libarary as you said. and it won't place it to the left as per your video. then when i try to open the main.js file as per your notes also using the node main.js it returns with an error since i dont have the Cyrpto.js installed. so how do you install it? I am using Ubint latest version and using Visual studio latest version. I am a newbie thank you!,0
Thanx a lot! 👍,0
yeah i wana see how file coin compares with storj,0
That's Visual Studio Code. And for npm to work you have to install node.js on your computer. Just go to their website and download the installer. Let me know if it works now ;),0
Simple and comprehensive as expected,0
"Smart contract auditing is so important. Quantstamp, Certik, Ambisafe are some companies which perform auditing",0

"If Oroboros is a copy of the DPOS in EOS, then why doesn't Dan also go get formally verified and prove it?

Can the DPOS system that Dan created sync from Gen block like Oroboros Gen (therefore making it provably more secured than the bitcoin chain)? With their differences already (not to mention Oroboros is not a DPOS) how can you proveably state that Cardano protocol (Oroboros) is copy of EOS protocol (DPOS)? Especially when ADA is provably secured by a number of outside agencies and EOS can be taken down through a smart contract flaw? EOS has potential, but I doubt that they will ever be able to achieve off chain transactions and effective side chains.

"I really do not understand the point of IBM Blockchain, or any other ""Blockchain as a Service"" offered by corporations. With IBM, they are storing the blockchain in IBM Cloud, meaning that IBM has full control over the blockchain's data. So how can we call it immutable? IBM has full control over all the nodes running in their cloud which store a copy of the blockchain. They can easily just change all the data in all of the nodes. So IBM Blockchain is really not much different from IBM's normal database services. I don't understand how IBM is selling this idea to customers like Walmart... They're basically saying with blockchains, you can trust the food data. But then are they saying that you can't trust the food data if it was stored in a regular IBM database?   It just leads me to believe that companies like IBM are just trying to capitalize on this blockchain hype, and selling their so called ""transparent and secure"" services to customers who are unaware of how blockchains are meant to work. Companies like Walmart would be much better off using Ethereum or some other public, decentralized blockchain which actually store tamper-proof data. Good job on your video btw!",0
Hey Savjee. Can you make a more detailed video in depth about how to actually do peer-to-peer trading?,0
"Doesn't prove anything. The proof is once these applications are built, used, and sustainable. A ton of these experiments will fail. Some will succeed. But most will fail.",0
Just the latest version. Still have the same error? Are you on Windows?,0
There is always a limited amount of trust required (especially if you cannot read the source code yourself). The key here is that it is transparent. Anyone who wants can check out the code while most other systems are just black boxes.,0
Can smart contracts be integrated partially with bother systems rather than block chain?,0
"Food tracking is perfectly doable. Put a tag on each piece of food and have companies scan it when it enters/leaves their facilities. It gets harvested? Farmer adds that event to the blockchain. Arrives at a shipping company, they add it as well. Arrives at the store, they add another event. Customer buys it, another event.   The used consensus algorithm is of no importance. You can use PoW or PoS, doesn't really matter as long as the chosen algorithm does in fact generate consensus amongst everyone on the network. The ""validators"" or ""miners"" in this example are every company who is involved in the process. They want to make sure that the data is not tampered with (so that the store cannot accuse the shipping company of bad practices for instance).    How is this better than the regular food tracking system? Well it's a LOT faster! Check out some of my sources ;)",0
"At some point, yes!",0
"Right now blockchains cannot really communicate with one another. They have no notion of what happens in other chains. That is something that people behind Cardano for instance try to solve. Thanks for the suggestion, could indeed be an interesting video!",0
Great to hear! Also check out the sources that I consulted for my research. I publish them for each video and they could inform you even more ;),0
"That's tricky because other systems usually aren't immutable. Let's say you write a smart contract that automatically compensates people who have been affected by a hurricane. To do that you use the API of a weather service. Problem is: how can you trust the output of that API? It can change its response with every request you make and you have no way of seeing all the responses it gave over time. To solve it, the weather service should publish its measurements on the blockchain. That way you have a verifiable and immutable trail of data.   Does that make sense?",0
"Sorry for the late reply (your comment was marked as spam by YouTube). Yes, in this video you can still tamper with the blockchain. Watch the next parts of the series ;)",0

"""The used consensus algorithm is of no importance."" Are you serious?  It must be granted that all participants in the supply chain do not have to trust each other (otherwise why a blockchain?)  Could HackMeNow be a good name for this blockchain? Have you heard about the numerous 51% attacks on some altcoins in the past few days?  Who pays the extra effort of validators?  Scanning a barcode and send this data to a blockchain is enough for you? What about temperature, humidity, hygenic conditions, ...? Who guarantees that the barcodes are not counterfeit?  What happens if you discover an error? Would you suggest to use an editable blockchain?",0

"Well, in my one-year+ of involvement of this topic, the best use of blockchain (or similar) technology seems to be for money.  As this video points out, there may be other uses, but in its use as money,  I think it could change the course of history (a little).

"Good explanation, but it sounds like bitcoin lightning network solve a bitcoin issue, but not a real life issue. Isn't it making it overly complex for a simple transaction? It doesn't really provide any value added to the current models that we already have in place for such transactions but instead make it more costly and complicated.",0
"From what I understand, in Lightning Network you will hold those coins in trust. Even though your coins are locked in the LN, you can still spend those coins in trust within the LN. So you create another pool of BTC meant for transactions within that LN.",0
"Also, the cost of each transaction can vary in an LN since it relied on the system to find the least cost route to transfer your coins. Highly volatile cost for a simple transaction like a cup of coffee.",0
PIVX works pretty good with PoS,0
"Thank you. I want to ask in practical, when is minePendingTransaction() called? Is that whenever the miner find an appropriate hash of new block?",0
"Centralized applications are known for being hacked into and information being tampered with. While on a blockchain, the ledger is distributed and information must be validated by selected participants before being added to the blockchain.",0
Blocks chained together right?,0
Genius.,0
Directly after you successfully mined a block or when the network (not implemented here) has mined a new block.,0
You are a perfect guru,0
I wonder how long will it be until the size of the blockchain increases beyond the maintenance capacity of the majority of nodes in the p2p network,0
"This is an awesome question! The storage requirements is definitely a possible pitfall for blockchains, however time is on their side. On may 1st, the Bitcoin blockchain was 156,3GB in size and 1 month later was 159,6GB. That's an increase of little over 3GB every month or 36GB per year. That's not fast enough to outgrow the capacity of nodes on the network. Also consider that storage nowadays is pretty cheap and the capacity of hard drives increases regularly. So the storage problem doesn't have to be solved immediately, there is still time left! However it will be very important as blockchains become more performant and handle more and more transactions per second.  Also note that certain developers are already working on this problem. Cardano for instance is thinking about pruning the blockchain and sharding/partitioning.",0
"The complexity is not an issue. I should have pointed out in the video that creating payment channels is completely automated and handled by software. People don't have to go through this process manually, they just pay the coffee shop and that's it. Don't get me wrong: it's definitely more complex compared to directly writing to the blockchain, but it does increase Bitcoin's scalability.",0
Glad you liked it! Cheers!,0
"A secure exchange can be setup whatever way you like (and whatever way you deem ""secure""). You could for instance meet in person and exchange encryption keys that way. You could send it over another encrypted channel that you trust (like messaging apps with end-to-end encryption).   ""How keys link together securely"" -> the RSA algorithm always generates a key pair. These are always linked.",0

"Thanks for the reply and it must be said that your video gave me a clear understanding of blockchain technology! It's great to know people are already working on the problem. I think Cardano is moving in the right direction, but if I understand it right that means some of the decentralised nature of the technology will have to be sacrificed.

Blockchains are secure. It's people who make mistakes. They store their wallet credentials in a way that's not secure. You can't blame the technology. Just like you cannot blame your door for being open and allowing someone to break in. It's you that left it open. Does that make sense?,0

"I have only seen 51% attacks in a few coins. There are hundreds to choose from that do a better job that those that have suffered a 51% attack. If companies adopt already existing cryptocurrencies, the problem of paying to validators is solved. Scanning a barcode is just an example. All the other things that you have mentioned depend on the sensors available and the willingness to track something. Maybe the company just wants to know where the package is. Why would it then care about hygienic conditions? Any data can be put on the blockchain including temperature, humidity, hygienic conditions. What do you mean by counterfeit barcodes? How many problems with barcodes have you seen in supermarkets now? Why would it be different? Don't get this question... What kind of error are you talking about?",0

"Vertical scalability, increases capacity by adding more resources, such as more memory or an additional CPU, to a machine. Scaling vertically, which is also called scaling up, usually requires downtime while new resources are being added and has limits that are defined by hardware. Horizontal scaling affords the ability to scale wider to deal with traffic. It is the ability to connect multiple hardware or software entities, such as servers, so that they work as a single logical unit. Lambda is horizontally scaling. I think this point is important but was not explained well in this video. However, the video is of high quality.",0

So anyone can join this peer to peer network and add to the validation of the data being transmitted.   I like what I hear but unable to imagine how that would work.   You’d register with some server who forwards you the hashes of other people’s blocks?   Yah the hash would make it hard to open packets and change em wo being detected so maybe,0
If you add to that handshaking and verify packet received before sending out the next and assuming a transaction requires many many packets then bingo the routers would have to be finite state machines with huge memories to process it for hacking.  But you’d have to authenticate the handshaking too with data.   That bit about 0000 hash on the first packet isn’t good.,0

These mining farms are sooooo ugly and reminiscent of the huge early computing systems.. It seems were not ready for a truely free crypto until the power and validation is also decentralized.. Not sort of decentralized.. Every person needs to be their own central bank essentially. Right now it feels like we're under a 51% attack. Many of the early investors may have had ties London finance and they may hold beliefs that crypto needs regulation. I we aren't the regulators and creditors and customers and providers then essentially we have just helped fund our own slavery... A  fedcoin.. Lest we not let this happen please. Crypto instead is bought and sold and traded and shorted and pumped and dumped and manipulated at what end? And private keys.. Who thought that was a good idea? It's the furthest from being user friendly. Could be a long crypto winter folks. I'm still bullish because the way the news anchors talk trash about crypto and the crypto communties in general. I doubt their reverse psychology game is better than my third eye game time will tell I will hodl on and check coinbase every ten minutes for the next 2 years it seems,0

"IPFS uses gateways that act somewhat like ISP (anyone can form a gateway) .   such gateways see the signature of the file you want to have and direct you to the right nodes. that means that you know the content in advance without downloading.  as far as malware, you only share the things you get a copy of, just like the regular internet, if you don't want to host malware... don't go to shady places , its the same deal.  as far as filecoin and hosting things you don't , they are fragmented and can't be accessed by accident , so even if you are hosting a part of something dangerous, you are not accessing it so no harm can be done, its like an unloaded gun, it won't shoot on its own without you touching it  as far as copyright issues , you prevent it the same way you do with torrents (you can't defend vs it), arrest half of the world that uses it , good luck.",0
"This is an interesting question! First of all, IPFS can't get around the laws of physics. So if radio transmission takes 14 minutes to reach Mars, it will take at least this long for a file to arrive there. The local cache on Mars is there to help speed up subsequent requests.   However editing articles is something that IPFS doesn't support. That has to be handled by another layer.   Also remember that with IPFS, once an object is published it cannot be changed anymore. If you request the file with hash XY, you will always get the same file. If it has been updated you will need to request a file with a different hash.",0

As the stake in the deposit will probably higher that the transaction fees but much lower that the transaction amount.

"DigiByte anticipated the scalability issues that would plague Bitcoin adoption. Thus, DGB designed it's blockchain so that it could handle Visa/Mastercard levels of volume, all while keeping all transactions on the blockchain. The problem with the Lightning Network is that it is an off-chain (meaning outside the blockchain) ""solution"".  This is no solution at all, for if we're okay with off-chain solutions, we might as well stick with Visa/Mastercard because they're already digital and already super fast.  Also, LN risks centralization because it'll have centralized hubs.  If you believe in the true spirit of crypto, you should be very leery of Lightning Network.",0

You size the thermal mass and the surface area of your dissipator to set how wide the temperature swing will be.  When I worked on cube sats in college, the range could be -50 to +80 C.  You have to design your stuff to handle that.  The temperatures you list are asymptotic limits.  If the spacecraft were fixed on either the dark on light side of the earth, the chassis will reach that temperature, and so will the electronics.",0

As I said in the video: the P2P protocol is not implemented here.,0
"So, this being said, why would you replace a third party with a smart contract? My answer is that having a smart contract in place, you will be charged a small fee when a transaction is made(when the smart contract gets executed).  As far as i know, this is the smart contract business model the companies are using right now. So, replacing a third party with a smart contract is a very effective way to lower your business costs. (First big advantage) But, from my point of view, there is another advantage of having a smart contract in place. As this video explains, the smart contracts are blockchain based, and there is very slightly chance for this to be corrupted/hacked.  What is really important here is that behind a smart contract there is CODE written. This means that when you replace a paper contract with a smart contract, you become digital. You actually replace words...with code.  And the real advantage here is that the code is not doubtful...it will always execute the same way. (Second big advantage) Great work with the video!",0

"Hi @Savjee, Really excellect video once again.. I have two queries :  1. As I understand, RTC is a counter which keeps track of the no of oscillations of the quartz crystal you've mentioned that when the computer boots up the OS will read time from RTC. How can the OS determine the exact time without the offset.   Let's say I shutdown my system at 5 PM and switched it back on at 6 PM, meanwhile let's say RTC's counter has incremented 555 times. In this example, 555 is the duration. OS can only know its 6 PM if it had stored the offset 5 PM. [Let me know if I'm not clear]  2. How does OS account for network delays when syncing with atomic clocks using NTP ?",0

Why the heck did they make the time value signed on those Linux devices? It would have doubled the possible lifetime!,0
"InDeepPudding First time with video of himself, didn’t recognize him either.",0
so is blockchain essentially a linked list?,0
1. The RTC uses the oscillations to actually keep track of the date and time. The OS has the ability to read from the RTC but also to set its value.   2. NTP compensates by subtracting the round-trip time and taking into account multiple synchronizations (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#Clock_synchronization_algorithm),0
You always made complicated thing explained in simple way. Super love your channel,0

What is to stop someone from exploiting Blockchain by using their own hashing function/library? I am assuming the legit Blockchain is run using SHA256 as in the video. An alternative hashing function could be written and run to collect a database of verified hash's. This would greatly reduce the time to find suitable fake/tampered hash's. Basically like locating where the needles in the haystack are ahead of time.,0

Thank you so much for explaining how blockchain works. But I have few doubts. If I tamper with a block why would I need to recalculate proof of work or hashes of the following blocks? Why can't I just change the previousHash of the next block to the hash of previous one after tampering? Proof-of-work is just delay while adding new blocks. Why do i need to add new blocks after tampering existing block?,0

"Not sure about that.  In a KeyConditionExpression the condition for the sort key has to be combined with the condition on the partition key. In this example date is the partition key, which means you have to query for an exact match. In order for you to use the between operator the sort key would have to be the date and the partition key a message_id (or something like that). I think it would require a redesign of the table.

"This is an amazing tutorial but would like to point out a small mistake. Isn't the isChainValid() method incorrect? Like it works if you modify the contents of the first block because it enters the for loop when i=1, but it finishes returning by then. So if you change the contents of the second block, the check will only be done for the first block and it will return true. I think something like this would work : isChainValid() {         let flag = true;         for (let i = 1; i < this.chain.length; i++) {             const currentBlock = this.chain[i];             const previousBlock = this.chain[i - 1];              if (currentBlock.hash !== currentBlock.calculateHash()) {                 flag = false;             }                          if (currentBlock.previousHash !== previousBlock.hash) {                 flag = false;             }         }         return flag;     }",0

"Very important correction: 1GHz processor doesn't necessarily mean it's 1billion instructions per second, but rather 1billion cycles per second. The cycle is literally an electrical wave (imagine it as ""sin"" graph). One instruction, however, can be measured in number of cycles and that's dependent of the machine architecture. So for example if a machine architecture decided that ""addition"" instruction needs 2 cycles, and that machine has a a processor of 1GHz: 1GHz ---> 1billion cycles per second ---> 500million addition instructions per second. A processor usually has many more instructions each of which requires different number of cycles. So measuring a processor's frequency in number of instructions per second is hard unless every instruction cost exactly 1 cycle, which is not realistic. Any way, I love your channel. You rock!",0

just so you know the blockchain you wrote allows for tampering with the last block since its hash is not referenced in any other block it can change freely.

Very useful video,0
Very well done!  This video took 6 minutes which other people took 15 minutes and still did not explain.,0
cancelling a channel is not free.,0
"you're asking the right questions, but the answers is not pretty.  LN routing requires knowledge of available paths, which means they have to solve the routing problem. They keep saying things like ""the internet works, we'll do it like that"", but the internet is built on trust and that trust is violated on a weekly basis.  The theoretical maximum transactions is infinite, but the maintainance costs for the network are not there exist estimates out there that suggests that you will be able to have somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 routing nodes before the system becomes unusable for all but the strongest and most well-connected nodes.  The solution acccording to market demand is likely to be few hubs with many connections, which would also help by acting as liquidity providers; giving those with money the ability to control / deny access.  In particular, when the underlying base layer fee subsidies (block rewards) approach zero, the costs of those 7 TPS on the main chain will be extreme and only the powerful high-speed centralized hubs will be able to afford it.  They also have all benefits from being gatekeepers so they will out-compete all regular usage on the main chain for pure profit, re-instating similar institutions and gatekeepers we initially adopted cryptocurrencies to remove.",0
"In theory you are supposed to keep a handful of channels open, and route through others when you encounter new merchants.  There is so many holes in this theory though, that it isn't funny. For example, do you think it would be reasonable for your local pizza shop to route other peopels money? Do you think parties that has the power to deny access (hubs/the other side of your channels) will be free from regulation?  I can't imagine a world where banks have to do KYC and AML, but a toy store can make money helping others transact without the state intervening and demanding that the toy store either sign up for money transmission licenses and do KYC and AML, or be forced to shut down operation altogether - likely with hefty fines.",0

"what will happen when bitcoin  reached 21 billions block?. the block will be end. after that happens, about transaction bitcoin between two person how miners will awarded?where  new data will be added?",0
best explanation ever,0
"No, its multiwii",0
Nowadays,0
There is no limit on the amount of blocks added to chain. Bitcoin limits the amount of coins to 21 million. When we reach that limit nothing special will happen. Blocks can still be created but miners will not get a block reward. In other words: no new bitcoins will be introduced into the system.,0
"Under normal circumstances, it will never change. However a hash does change if the contents of a block has been changed. Usually this only happens when someone tampers with it. But it can also occur naturally when there is an issue with the underlying storage device for instance.",0
"It's a difficult question. Truth be told: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have no value by themselves. Even the Dollar and Euro don't have any value. Instead we place our trust in other people: as long as everyone is willing to accept Dollars, Euro's, Bitcoins it has value.     Personally I don't believe that wasting electricity adds value to Bitcoin. It's purely the people using it!",0
Why would it require KYC? It's almost like having a private blockchain between two wallets. It allows you to quickly transact with someone else. You don't need to know their identity. The only difference is that with Lightning you only write to the blockchain when you want to open/close the channel.,0
It could happen in a secure way by using encryption. Then you could also allow only certain people to see your records (ie your doctor),0
There is some confusion with the 0.001 BTC coffee but deducted 0.005 from Bob.,0
put your money in bank then. lol,0
"But you can't comply with the rule that any user must be able to get it's data removed from the systems, unless you delete the whole chain, or recalculate everything.",0

Your ether will stay in your wallet even after these updates. However it's better to keep your coins in a real wallet and not on a exchange. It's safer and could be beneficial if the currency splits (real hard fork),0

Thanks for this and I get the concept more solidly than before. Question though on this condition currentBlock.hash !== currentBlock.calculateHash(). This validation does not apply to the last block when validating?  I played around  it and it's correct on the blocks in between but using this on the last block it seems to return  as valid. Or is there something here I misunderstood. Thanks in advance!,0

I'd think that, if the main chain is completely copied, all the addresses up to that point would be the same for both new and old coins.

I would suggest learning the basics about computers and programming. Pick a language and learn it in depth. Then you can dive into the code of existing projects and see how they do certain things. The Bitcoin codebase for instance uses C++.,0
It's already implemented. This video is about how blockchains actually work right now!,0
"It's in case someone wants to tamper with it. There is nothing preventing you from changing data in a block. You can do it, because it's your copy of the blockchain. However you cannot convince the other nodes on the network of your changes. They will see it as an attempt to fool them.",0

DO i have to create a wallet? or do I get a confirmation email with my Hash saying thank you for your purchase?,0
Coinbase manages everything for you and they make it pretty easy. You transfer money to them and they put your dollars/euros into your account. Afterwards you can use your dollars to purchase bitcoin. Again coinbase will handle the creation of a wallet automatically.,0
So you're saying you're confused but that it's not complex at the same time? Huh?,0

"You don't trust it. Fiat money has been a huge failure. It's why the US government wants to control the flow of oil. They're trying to - unofficially - put the Dollar on an Oil Standard. You can only fiat it in the short term. As soon as you have you have a single year in which the market doesn't grow, you get a nationwide apocalypse. It's why today's recession's are so catastrophic. It's why the government HAS to bail out failing industry. Because if we get economic shrinkage, even for a small amount of time, the whole monetary system collapses.  The austrians - the von Mises guys - have been warning of this for years. They were among the first to predict the 2008 crash. They also predicted - not taking into account government intervention - the collapse of the Dollar. And the government bailing out the banks only serves to kick the can down the road. The next recession will be worse. The one after that, even more so. Until the government WON'T be able to bail the business out.  Now, as for crypto, aside from it being a very stupid idea, you encounter even more problems. For one, a Bitcoin-like system incentivizes saving (HODL-ing, as it were). Fiat was built to incentivize spending. If you want adoption, you first have to get a lot of people holding a lot of assets in your crypto, so that business will take the risk in order to tap a large amount of the potential market (current fiat money avoid this problem by having the government enforce use of the money by force). Secondly, you need miners. THEY are the early adopters (maybe you can avoid this with Ethereum, or other established coins, but you want competition amongst coins, and new ones to arise all the time). Third, all money would ultimately gravitate towards a few nodes (especially if they wouldn't spend it).",0

If that were the case, words in our language that have been mutated to mean different things from their original purpose would not carry the negative or positive connotation they do. ""Gay"" for example, look up the original meaning, yet society as a whole uses it for something else. In regard to Guy Fawkes, the majority of society associates it with ""Hacker"", good or bad (many people don't know ethical hackers exist). The devil is perceived as ""Evil"", so in this video, a devil would not be appropriate to the message being given. Tampering with blockchain blocks is not an evil process but rather a hacker process.

"Very well explained, as in all of your videos (i loved the graph theory!!!) But one question stays in my mind: Where do all the Computers come from, that operate the system, if nobody is paying them ...",0
Well everyone who wants to make a transaction has to approve 2 other transactions. That's what makes the network run.,0
The fee is equal to the fee of a normal transaction. So its a lot cheaper if you can do many transactions in the same channel.,0
No worries! Thanks for the kind words!,0

This is super clear and to the point. Thanks so much!!,0

"You must have configured your API endpoint as ""proxy"". So the gateway only acts as proxy, i.e. forwards the returned value from your lambda function. If you want your gateway to act as proxy, you have to return a valid JSON, including statuscode and body. example return value: {""statusCode"":200, ""body"": generatedNumber}. This way you can configure your API as proxy and let the lambda function handle response format.  On the other hand, you can leave ""proxy"" parameter unchecked and let the gateway handle response format. This way, you only return generatedNumber at your lambda function, and configure gateway to wrap it under a JSON format.",0
I still don`t understand,0

How many users can a single block have ?,0
Depends on the Blockchain. Bitcoin for instance can store a maximum of 2000 transactions per block. Others might have a lower or higher limit.,0
Any questions in particular?,0
Thank you for saving my presentation!,0
"hey Xavier, really good one. as linguists say, CBS, Clear Brief and Sincere!",0
So all  or 50% of the 2000 has to authenticate the new block? And a problem will raise when more than 1 wants to create a new block at the same time ?,0
Very wonderfully explained. Finally I got it,0
"Yes, at least half of the network has to approve the new block. If not, the block is rejected. It is possible that two poeple create a valid block at the same time. This is a natural fork. The network however only chooses one of the blocks and builds on top of it. The other block becomes stale and transactions inside will be re-executed.",0
Why do people get a reward from being able to create a new block?,0
"Not a good example,  Kick starter delivers the money to the product team, because they need money to pay their suppliers to make their project become alive. That is the point of funding. And if they fail to deliver the promised products to the backers, then kickstarter will ask the product team to return money. If they can not return, nothing to do(there are few examples happened before) and sometimes they manage to refund. But you're accepting the risk when you fund.   So in this case, you say smart contract will not release the funded amount to product team until they deliver the promised products to the backers, but product team is not able to manufacture the product without this money, so this example is not a good example for smart contracts. It just doesn't make sense.",0
"No, I said that the smart contract will only release the funds when the project is fully funded. That is also how Kickstarter works.",0
"It creates an incentive for people to create and verify blocks. Without the incentive, people would have no reason to do it.",0
Thank you for patiently answering my questions,0
Awesome video! Really good!,0
You should make a Simply Explained on EOS!,0
"How complex are smart contracts expected to be, and how do we know they'll work?  For example, I suppose a contract can stipulate the following simple transaction:  1) Purchaser selects article 2) Selected article is drawn from inventory by seller 3) Article is shipped by an approved carrier 4) Carrier obtains signature from purchaser or their agent (perhaps permissible agents must be specified) 5) Certain period of time elapses after signature to provide for return of defective or non-conforming article 6) Funds are irrevocably transferred  For your average John Doe, that will take a lot of computer code that isn't familiar to everyone (and Solidity isn't going to be here for much longer!), but let's continue.  John Doe doesn't want to hire a programmer, so he selects a proper-looking ready-made contract that has earned high approval from a certified board (certified by whom?, pray tell) designated to read the open-source code and certify that it does what it seems to be intended to do.  Of course, only certain board-certified open-source contracts will be offered by the seller.  We must hope that no unseen vulnerability has escaped the certified board (SQL insertion, overflow, the usual suspects).  If that happens, who's responsible?  It looks like we just added a whole layer of professional people to what used to be a simple dispute call to AmEx or Visa, but let's continue.   Now, what if there's a complex contract that's unique to parties who are doing a large and costly project (Multiple sources, QC inspection, time restrictions, all-or-nothing execution, etc)?  First, as always, a legal team has to be engaged to write the contract in a way that suits the principal players.  In the absence of a perfunctory, one-size-fits-all contract like the sample above, a programming team has to be engaged to turn the legalese into computerese.  (Few lawyers speak English with boolen clarity, let alone Javascript, or C#, -- or Haskell!) Since there won't be a whole lot of repetition and board-certified reading of open-source contracts, an insurance company with its own code readers will have to be engaged to provide a bond that guarantees the correct behavior of the smart contract.    Now we've added an insurance company to the smart contract writing company.  More overhead.  I suppose that, after 40 or 50 years, certain contract templates will be recognized by the business community, but before then, there will be lots of  unforseen circumstances and ensuing hostilities.    Of course, even today, a contract is only a basic directive for parties who trust one another.  If someone's out to screw you, they'll put in some clause that your team doesn't catch and you'll be exposed to taking a loss.  The MAIN reason for a contract is to define rights and obligations, not to prevent dirty dealings.  If you the person you're dealing with isn't worthy of trust, no contract will help.  That's a rule.    So, with all of that said, I feel that we're running headlong into a situation where people might be lulled into thinking things are ""trustless"".  I'm all for the level of trustlessness needed simply to transfer funds safely (like, to your brother.)  But there CAN'T be a trustless environment in ACTUAL BUSINESS.    Any comments on these observations?  Maybe the only contract necessary (beyond the basic one I submitted) is the one for escrow -- and leave everything else just the way it has always been. The lawyers are headache enough!  In that case, the world will only need 1/2 dozen small, generally recognized smart contracts, right?    So, my question restated is: Just what kinds of contracts are being proposed?  Everyday simple things, or matters of unique complexity?  (Sorry if I rambled a bit, but I think you get the gist of what I'm saying.)",0
"""Even though the keys are linked together, they cannot be derived from each other""   Isn't that wrong? Sure, it might take so much computer power that you need a quantum computer to do it, but isn't it theoretically possible to derive a private key from the public key?  Isn't that why scientists are looking into better encryption methods in case quantum computing takes off?",0
"Interesting question. First of all, as you said smart contracts should not be super complicated. The risks of having a bug in there is just too big. See the incident with the DAO that led to an Ethereum hard fork for instance.   If something happens with a smart contract, it's hard to point fingers. Just like with a real contract. If a certain clause is too vague, who's fault is that? The lawyer who wrote it? The people who reviewed it? At this point however the damage is already done so might as well try to recover instead of pointing fingers.  I follow your reasoning concerning the overhead. Creating a smart contract with the same amount of details as regular contracts will be very time consuming. But after that, the contract can operate autonomously and always give a binary output. There won't be any gray zones. If you look at insurances for instance, it would mean that they won't be able to come up with clever tactics to avoid a possible payout.   Hmm yes, you're also correct when you say that this system isn't entirely ""trustless"". You still have to trust the code of the contract as well as the network that runs it. Just as you have to trust the software that runs on your computer not to steal any personal data. So good point! Smart contracts make sure that we don't have a central authority but we still have to trust the system.   There are few smart contracts out there already, but nothing really complicated. There is the DAO which is a decentralized venture capital fund where people can vote for who should receive money. All tokens are powered by a smart contract. And so on...   But the summary is: most smart contracts today are relatively small and simple. There are also efforts to make ""standard"" contracts that are safe and can be re-used (such as the ERC20 standard that describes a smart contract to issue tokens on the Ethereum blockchain).",0
"Thanks for the quick reply.  I'll be interested to see how this goes.  So far, I have no personal interest in breedable cat pictures, magic game swords or ICOs, and I fear the insurance example isn't as cut-and-dried as we might hope.    I can picture things like title transfer, but since house and car ownership require government registration, those things would probably still be done best on government servers.    There's securities transfer (and I imagine that an all-or-nothing securities transfer can be done on a Turing-incomplete blockchain) and maybe visas for quota-controlled imports.     I just don't automatically picture real-life use cases.  As I said, I'll be watching to see what becomes available -- the simple fact that I can't picture something doesn't mean it won't happen.

"sorry if this sounds like a stupid question (still trying to understand blockchain), but would a faulty genesis block then ruin the entire chain?

"If the data from outside that goes into the blockchain has to be honest, it's all over at that point. You are trusting people and might as well use a normal database that will be more efficient. Useless application for blockchains.",0
Why would any company want all their data stored in a way that it is accessible by anyone including their competitors? Also data protection laws require companies to protect the data of their users from others so using blockchain is not possible in the first place.  In my oppinion blockchain for companies only works with data that they have to or are willing to share anyways like your WallMart example. But even then why use a blockchain when you can use much easier systems like a website to publish that data?  Another issue I see with blockchain is the human factor. Humans make errors when entering data. What if false data are entered into the blockchain? Now I can never correct that mistake again because it is designed that you can't change data in the blockchain? Not very practicable. In a regular database the admin or others could correct it. What happens in case of WallMart if a meat producer accidentally enters data saying a shipment of meat is chicken when it actually is turkey?   And don't even get me started on the much higher energy consumption of blockchains compared to other systems.  I am not saying blockchain is totally useless but its useful use cases are much more limited than the current hype suggests in my oppinion.,0

Well anyone is free to use the money as he likes. There is nothing preventing people from taking it and running away with it (it can also happen on Kickstarter). You could add safety features to the contract however. Like keeping a certain amount of money locked up until the supports signal that they have received their orders. Something along those lines. Smart contracts can do anything you want ;),0

Well keep an eye out! It wasn't my first time in Sweden and it probably won't be my last. Really love the country! Thanks for your suggestion! I'll see what I can do about the new Javascript videos.,0
Thank you ;),0
"A lot of stuff here to address. You make some valid arguments. Data protection and blockchain are two topics that are hard to mix (but not impossible).   It's true that companies usually don't want to decentralize their business because that would put them out of work (like Kickstarter for instance). However that leaves the door open for others to do it. I can imagine that people passionate about open source would want to create decentralized alternatives to eliminate intermediaries.   Is publishing to a website easier? Absolutely! But it has its disadvantages. It's not distributes, there is a single point of failure and as a user you can't know if someone has tampered with the website.   The human factor is indeed an import factor and people will indeed make mistakes. The key here is to automate all of this to prevent people from making mistakes and to prevent tampering with data. The immutability doesn't have to be a problem. You can design a system that allows you to revise the data by adding updates to your blockchain. Something similar to what IPFS does.   The energy consumption is something that is being actively worked on. This is a property of the proof-of-work algorithm. Alternatives like Proof-of-stake are much more energy efficient.",0
"Yep, you can always tamper with the data before it goes into a blockchain. But you can minimize that risk by automating it as much as possible. You can use sensors to automatically insert certain events (like GPS location for instance). Additionally a blockchain is distributed and prevents people from tampering with data. Something you can't easily do or guarantee with a regular database.",0

This is so strange. I have watched tons of videos on blockchain and as a programmer it took watching this video in code language for this to be fully understood.

What is the difference between a private key and a public key? If only the private key is unique does it mean that you can send coins to multiple wallets that share the same public key at once?

AWSome,0
Thank you very helpful 🤝,0
"make one complete Blockchain, video that cover all concept",0

Haha nice one!,0
Private and public key are both unique. The public key is freely shareable with anyone. It's the address of your wallet. The private key on the other hand is used to sign transactions. It proves that the owner of the wallet is taking money out of it. It should be kept secret so only you can spend your coins.,0

Excellent talk 👏🏻 share you apresentation,0
"Dude, can you explain how one can protect himself from this? You didn't, actually. You've just advised to install something, but didn't describe how the 'something' works. For example, what role 'no third-party cookies' setting plays here? Assume, it blocks third-party cookies, but does it block also third-party cookies I've already accepted (like facebook cookies, which are third-party, but if you are logged in, they already present in your browser)? I mean, if you have your facebook cookies and visit a website with facebook 'share' button, will 'no third-party cookies' setting block any _changes_ in cookies if these changes were requested not by a website you are currently on or will it just allow any changes for these third-party cookies, because you've already accepted them for facebook and have some of them in your browser? Or this works another way? Like, when facebook code inserted into a website, facebook can get the URL of the website when you send some requests from the website, and when it happens, your cookies stay unchanged, but facebook gets your authentification info and gets URL of the website you're currently on and just writes this into the database?  How _technically_ one can protect himself from cookie tracking? I have EditThisCookie extension, but I'm not sure it can do something about that - because I do not understand how it works. Because if cookie shouldn't be necessarily changed for this, protecting them with the extension will do nothing. In that case one can only protect himself if he blocks such requests from non-related websites completely, I assume.",0

"Actualy I think that the name ""public key"" is somewat misleading. It is not a KEY because it doesnt open anything .. it's more like a trezor. I give you opened trezor and only I knows combination to open it once its closed. So after you close it you cant open it again, anyone can .. only me because I have a key/combination. I can give anybody these opened trezors so they can put things in, close it and send it back to me.",0

This is something that IPNS can solve. This system allows you to link a hash to a name. That way it becomes easier to remember and to use. You can compare it to DNS. This links a domain name (google.com for instance) to an IP address of a server somewhere.,0
Hmm I don't follow. Nonce is just used for mining and to calculate the hash of the block (AFAIK).,0

System beaten. No?",0
but how the forger validate transactions and make blocks technicaly ? is they're doing that manually ? please explain,0
Which is why we have decentralization my friend,0
No it's not a manual process. An algorithm basically checks each transaction that can be included in the block. They check if the transaction can take place (sufficient balance) and if the transaction has been correctly signed by the person who is sending money (public/private key),0
Yes there will still be rewards. Otherwise people would have no incentive to stake their coins ;) But block rewards will be killed. That's the reward you get for mining a new block. No mining = no block rewards.,0
"Hang on, these are two different things! Proof-of-work doesn't verify the transactions inside a block. It's just a way to slow down the creation of blocks. It's a reliable way to prevent people from making a ton of blocks at once. Verifying transactions is something else. To do that, the miner checks that each transaction was signed with the correct keys (eg the key of the person who sends the money). It also checks if that person has a high enough balance to make that transaction. Hope that makes more sense now ;)",0

You should be able to follow the same instructions. Just make sure that you use the correct IP address of your droplet instead ;),0
"Hehe, not a fan of white backgrounds? Yeah my colleagues also think I'm crazy but I kind of like it :)",0
"Sure! It's actually really simple. Each node on the network knows about all the transaction that have ever happened on the blockchain. If I received 6 transactions of 10 coins, then each node can calculate that my balance is 60 coins. So in summary: checking the balance of a wallet means checking all the transactions to and from that wallet.",0
The validator gets to keep the transaction fees. That's his reward for keeping his node online.,0
"It depends on the size of the blockchain network. In Bitcoin's case it is going to be pretty hard to get that much computing power. But on smaller blockchains it's trivial (like you said). So the system is indeed beatable, especially proof-of-work. That's why many projects are working on new consensus algorithms (like proof-of-stake) to balance this.",0
Sure! Just give credit where it's due ;),0
every coins are scam.,0

"Blockchain never existed, it was GDPR all along. LoL",0
I agree with you 100per cent thanks for telling it like it is. Keep it real 24/7.,0
Gov is not God. Don't care if blockchain doesn't comply with the law. Change the stupid law. Blockchain is the law now!,0
"@Simply Explained Gov regulations are unreasonable and most of the time unnecessary and almost always hurt entrepreneurship. If someone isn't violent or financially dishonest leave them alone. Government should just busy themselves with citizen health care services, assisting the elderly, makig roads and tweeting angry messages.",0
There is Damm security in the blockchain as nobody can hack it then why you worried about privacy when you data is secured ???,0
"Point 3 @6:30 is the technology used by unik-name project, except that they distribute the data to a large number of storage provider and incentivize them with network rewards.",0
I agree with you that sometimes governments impose regulation that are too strict. They can indeed hurt innovation. In case of privacy however I think we're in need of strong regulation. Especially if you consider recent events surrounding Facebook (as an example). Collecting a ton of personal data without properly informing users is not acceptable.,0
"Yes. Imagine you want to transfer me some money but you don't have a direct channel with me. Let's further assume that you have a direct channel with a friend, who in turn has a direct channel with me. Instead of opening a new channel yourself (which costs money), the transaction can reach me through your friend.",0
Very good question (I should've addressed this in the video). The idea here would be that you create a new entry on the blockchain every time you update the data on the server. You could even keep track of the versions on the server (so all hashes in the blockchain remain valid for as long as the data is there).,0
"The data inside a blockchain is completely open. It's very secure, just not private.",0
"I partially agree with you. Governments should be careful when they introduce restrictive laws because they can have a bad effect on innovation. However, in this case I make an exception. Our privacy is being violated left and right while users have no real rights to prevent this from happening. The industry has brought this on themselves and I believe GDPR is actually a step in the right direction. But it's definitely not perfect either.",0
"@Simply Explained Oh thanks! I've probably lost this, English is not my first language.",0
No problem ;),0

i was expecting more details about software.but yet a good effort by you.,0
"​@Simply Explained Ok, I understood, but question is: If I have friend  who have a friend who have channel with you, can I send you money? In this case is more than one host between us.",0
"Yes, it can go across many channels to reach me. However at some point it will be more efficient to just open a direct channel with me. The software handles this all automatically and makes sure that you can send me money with the least amount of fees.",0
sorry i dont get it  why do you tamper hash? dont you want to tamper data?,0
"@Simply Explained ok, thanks for answer, it looks good, I have to test it, which wallet do you recommend?",0
I finally get it. Well done. I have been trying to figure out what blockchain was for a very long time and nobody seemed to be able to explain it.,0
"@1:05 ""Now these are pretty much self explanatory"".  Riiiiiiiiiiight. This is the biggest obstacle I encounter as a boomer trying to sort through this material. Every content provider is a computer engineer and  just assumes that everybody else is also an engineer. It's a lot like journalists and media types who just assume every agrees with them because everyone they encounter in their little world DOES agree with them.  So just to introduce you to a world you've never encounter called ""reality"", these terms are and actions are actually NOT self explanatory. Each term has a specific definition and each action has specific characteristics and these have to be known and understood before using them. Not exactly of ""self explanatory"" now is it?",0
This is awesome! Exactly what I need!,0

"@Simply Explained When you explain stuff like this, i think its a very good speed",0
what ide does he use here?,0
Good info. Storing large data offchain is the solution for a blockchain dApp because of these reasons: - difficult to query  - it will be of heavy size leading to too many big data centres in future. - existing data can't be changed but modified. That's why it is definitely the way to bring decentralization. Pls make a video on ZCash,0
+Software Man LoL.......  how old are you ...????,0
+Konseq...... you have totally missed The most important part of block-chain tec..... !!!!   the ledger is consensus based ... meaning that NOTHING is written to the block-chain until a certain number of people or contracts have analysed & agreed that the transaction is correct ..... if it is not correct it is automatically rejected after an amount of time... ie: not written to the block-chain ....,0
Excellent video sofa,0

"Well, a have a question in the case of bitcoin's blockchain, the one that requires 10 min ""proof of work"".

"Complete novice here, but I have a suggestion. Why not assign blocks to users by scaling the size of their stake with the transaction value of the block? So have some sort of sliding scale where somebody with a smaller stake will get blocks of smaller transactions, and somebody with a larger stake will get blocks of larger transactions, kind of like tax brackets. And arrange it so that everybody (having over a relatively small stake in the currency) gets roughly the same amount of blocks to process.",0

"i dont like idea some can do POS .... point is that everyone can do it , whenever they want ... not to be elected. If you buy gpu you can start mining right now with your PC, thats decentralization . Ones who can be validators and need to be elected its pretty much central cuz it prone tu manipulation. And we know they have influence cuz they are developers so they can take money from treasury when ever they wan. How .... they provide node delegates-nodes-pool owners with some generous airdrops for ordinary ppl to vote for them so you get small that he can get a lot. Its Theft on high level.",0
"Yes, but it still seems to be taking the community forever to create non-crypto blockchain apps that everyone would want to use.

It just feels like we should have already had that by now, and we still dont. Is the community lacking vision or ideas?",0
"I think the problem is govt incompetence at regulating things. Just look at how they regulate food or drugs for instance, or even polluted corporate behaviors.

On that basis, no one can seriously expect govt to manage blockchain or personal information or design regulatory rules for it in an intelligent and competent manner.",0

Look at all the data associated with your food example. That would create an insane amount of overhead to have that sort of data input for every single piece of food. It's completely unfeasible. And even if it wasn't how would that help if the consumer pays for that food with cash. And going the other way - using credit/debit or any other traceable currency then you open yourself up to being datamined in everything you do. Yeah, that's a hard pass thanks. Not all technology is a boon or benefit to mankind. It's pretty easyt to argue that most of them are the antithesis of that, and this is certainly one of them.

"Correct me if I'm wrong but the whole point of PoW is that it's hard to get the right hash but super easy to verify it.  So my question is even if one pool owned 51% of the hash power literally as soon as they post the false hash as a solution it can be checked to be known as false so I don't see how they could fake it.  Also I don't understand how you even could fake it if a hash consists of previous data from the block chain and new transactions ran though a hash algorithm doesn't faking a hash also fake a transaction?  And if so since things like public and private keys exist on wallets no one can fake that you sent money except you so again wouldn't this be super easy to verify as false once the hash is posted? As immediately you can run the hash and be like hey uh this transaction didn't use the correct private and public key combo this is fake.  Point is it's already hard enough to fake it and then by PoW's very nature it's super easy to tell a fake/bad hash from a real one.  I agree that the amount of power miners for bitcoin use is ridiculous and not scale-able at all in terms of how much power is used and how many transactions are added to the ledger.  But once bitcoin halves for the last time and other coins stop having block rewards through inflation miners will be getting paid through transactions fees at that point anyway, PoS as it stands just seems like a half baked solution imo, especially considering that most coins that use it don't have much market cap preventing someone from getting 51% of it.",0
"Fun fact you'd probably like it's highly likely Satoshi didn't create bitcoin and isn't who he says he is. Him being from Japan makes zero sense when you compare it to the original code of bitcoin and his forum posts, the way the notes are written in his code and the slang he used was indicative of that of someone who lives in the UK or europe.  Also his original forum posts fall in a time frame that would be most common for someone living in europe if he was living in japan while developing bitcoin that would mean that he was up making posts during really weird hours of the day even on weekends and weekdays",0

"Thanks for sharing.  I am a professional embedded SW developer and SpaceX enthusiast; so, I had been curious about their code.   I was glad to hear they use Unix and that they don't use Python (the horrible preferred choice of a lot of Mechanical types).  I am a seasoned C++ programmer and do like that choice; but, I think a managed programming language like C++ of Java might have some advantages.   C++ is a loosely constrained language and is also un-managed; so, it can be more difficult to find subtle bugs (like unassigned pointers, and memory leaks) and much more dangerous when you miss them.  There are techniques for limiting this; but, programmers are still people and they can make and miss mistakes and testing every possible code path is often not possible.   I am sure the developers on the Ariane 5 did lots of testing and still somehow missed the code bug that caused the failure.   Anyone that claims their code is 100% bug free is either deluding themselves, lying, or not looking.  I am not really sure which one of those is worse.  The advantage of C++; though, can be better real-time determinism.  With UNIX and C++ on an X86 core, one project I was on achieved sub-microsecond determinism. At the speeds they are flying, that may be the bigger concern.  There are ways to build more safety of C++ code, especially if they don't use other people's libraries.  Thanks for the cool info.",0

"Depending on the type of radiation you are trying to absorb it can take a non-trivial amount of water to do so. You can't just put a thin layer on there and call it good. Also, water sloshes around and on something like a rocket you don't want any off-axis sloshing, so if you have a non-trivial amount of water you have to keep it very tightly contained. And now you run into some other problems... depressurization, as you go into orbit, will cause expansion and boiling of the water, so it must be contained within a pressure vessel, and the computer. Which makes it a pain in the butt to do any sort of repairs on, and you have to worry about another pressure vessel for every single processor. And you have to heat it because water tends to freeze at -248 C. So you have added orders of magnitude of complexity and numerous additional failure points. So no... you don't just coat the damn computer in water at all.",0

"All of your points make no sense.   Satoshi ""who is either a group or people or one person with a fake name"" is just the man who made Bitcoin. He made a few transactions and mined for a bit as a proof of concept and everyone else ran with it.  He then went into hiding, but we still have information of his transactions so we know whatever Satoshi Nakamoto was he was on the blockchain and he made transactions and that's all a blockchain should tell you about a person.   Wanting the Blockchain to assist in having people pay their taxes is an evil thing to suggest. Taxes are mandatory but Bitcoin nor blockchains were made so it could serve the IRS.   Bitcoin is based on scarcity. The amount of whole coins that could possibly be missing that Satoshi personally mined is irrelevant when fractions of a bitcoin are worth hundreds of dollars.",0

I don't understand.,0
At 2:45 if the balls would be the same color... This i do not understand. How does probability of 1/2 changes to 1/4 o.0,0
The probability is now low enough to convince the friend? This is confusing,0
"Dominik Sosnowski in the example you’re trying to prove to your friend that the balls are a different color. So asks you a question that you wouldn’t be able to reliably answer if the balls were the same color - you would just have to guess. But because they are a different color, you don’t have to rely on guessing. Think of it like this - if someone asked you to guess a number between 1 and 10, you have a 10% chance of being right. But if you knew for a fact that the number was 7, then it wouldn’t even require guessing.  The probability goes from 1/2 to 1/4 because when you’re determining the probability of getting the right answer for repeated events, you multiply the probability of the individual events together. In this case, the probability for the first and second event are both 1/2 (50% chance of getting the right answer by guessing), so the chance of getting it right both times is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 This probability gets successively lower by repeating the event more times.",0
"I really liked the example using color blindness, it was a neat solution. An alternative to repeating the shuffle and question process to get higher probability of correctness would be to cut a piece out of one ball, then cut up the other ball into many pieces, then mix the pieces in such a way that the person doing the mixing knew where the one piece was, while the person asserting that the balls are a different color does not. This is more destructive, and more complex, but possibly faster if you needed high probabilities of correctness quickly.  As many other comments have said, I’d be interested in further videos on this topic.",0
Omg thank you. I had to make sure I understood this before investing in it,0
"@Noah McCann aha, thank you for lengthy explanation. So we talking about a lower probability of me lying about the color cause for the color blind friend it doesn't matter what's the color but he cares about the biggest probability of me telling the correct answer?",0
"Dominik Sosnowski precisely. In the example, your friend is already skeptical of your answers. But the probability of you correctly guessing the right answer goes down with each repetition of shuffling the balls around and asking for your guess. The only way that you could be right every time after a large number of repetitions is that you aren’t guessing - you’re using some additional information to inform your answer. In this case, that additional information is knowledge about color.  Now, something the video doesn’t touch on is the fact that you could be using knowledge other than color - for instance maybe you’re able to see behind his back by using a reflection. Or maybe you know that your friend will do a certain shuffle order - thus not being completely random and giving you a slight advantage above and beyond the 50/50 odds one would expect. The example assumes randomness and what kind of knowledge you have access to.",0
"Awesome, but can you please explain about non interactive zero knowledge proof in another video? Thanks~",0

"Dominik Sosnowski , If someone kept knowing exactly what you did to the balls, how long would it take you to believe that they are different? You see them both as the same but he always knew what you did behind your back... What are the chances he guessed it right 5 times? Still not sure? Go for 10... even 20... do you still think he guessed it 20 times? What are the chances he guessed correctly 20 times? There is almost no way someone can guess something 20 times or even 10 times in a row.. the probability of him doing so is extremely small.  That's the meaning there",0

Great tutorials for beginners who want to learn about this new exciting technology. Can you also do a video on Smart Contracts in this series.,0
Enjoy your vids. 2 errors here. 1) PoS does not change the cost of running a node. A node is not the same as a miner. A node validates transactions and does not mine. A miner orders transaction. 2) 51% attack is not relavent to PoS. Also there are some obvious attacks on PoS not mentioned like stake grinning,0

How can I use this technology?,0
You can use bitcoin for global transactions.,0
"The thing is, the system works ONLY for the people who follow the rules.  Faked blocks or transactions are simply ignored.  Editing a past block does nothing because referencing it for a new transaction will instantly make it invalid to all the other nodes.  Nodes only need to validate past blocks once, and the proof of work ensures it has been unchanged. Each new block mined makes all previous blocks more secure.  Each node keeps an identical running tally of all unspent transactions (called the UTXO set) - from this, it is easy to figure out how much bitcoin is contained in addresses associated with any particular wallet.",0

@SAL etherium classic was hacked using eth algo by some asic miners which gave them high hash power / rate to build an longer chain than the public chain allowing them to do double spending.Thats the reason why etherium has delayed their new release and also they have come up with ppow programable proof of work.,0

You really explain things simply ✌️,0
"1. I use nodejs. Other runtimes are available including C# with .NET Core 2. Both are fine. I personally use AWS and keep everything there. Haven't really used Azure. 3.

"So pending transctions aren't secured by the blockchain before mining. They are ""just there"" in the system right? They will get commited by a miner when his mining is succesful.

solid info :D,0
@Simply Explained I know that you wanted to tell that we're not alone to neglect this risk... But you should still feel bad because you should not compare yourself to the average people when we are talking about IT security.

"Great video that makes this concept so much more understandable for those with little or zero computer know how.  I just wish there was a system that could not fall victim to corruption of any kind, but once you add the ""human factor"" even the barter system can be cornered if you possess enough convincibility of your ""authority"".",0

"Quick question: what is preventing the Googles and youtubes of this world to become a major node on the block chain and cash in enormous rewards for having an incredible amount of data available at all times? They would just continue as they do now but with extra income? In both PoS and PoW they would probably have the overhand, no? Thx",0
Thanks so much for the code snippet :-),0
Still lots of safety-issued questions left.  That herr are still only the basic informations.,0
Well technically they can do this. And given the scale of Google I would guess they would just takeover the network completely.,0

"amazing video, simple and clear. Nice. We want more like this :)",0
"Same here I get -10. Although after 2nd mining my balance is 90. And maybe this is correct: your reward (after 1st mining) goes to pending transactions to be mined by someone else (so it doesn't credit your balance yet and you're still on -10). After 2nd mining, when your reward transaction has been mined (from pending) and added to the chain, now the balance is 90.",0
Nothing new invented. Just a bunch of dumb people thinking its new. You can do this with any modern database.,0
Except those setups require you to have to trust a third party - not so with Bitcoin.,0
"Any tampered blocks are simply ignored as doing so will give an invalid hash.  If a miner tries to tamper a new block, it will be dropped as an invalid block.",0
"@SAL Wrong. All companies creating something on a new blockchain are the central source for all the information. Without them, the product wouldn't exist. It doesn't matter that it's distributed. They provide the central API and all services to access the ""blockchain"". A company can distribute a database too. A blockchain is just another term for a database with versioned history. It's nothing new, exciting or revolutionary.",0

"@unknown what you described totally does NOT apply to Bitcoin, the original decentralized blockchain.  But I will agree with the fact that most other blockchains are just ""centralized databases"" controlled by companies - not really appropriate to call them blockchains.",0
"My love for cryptos and the technology behind them is huge, that's why I’d want to share this interesting story with as many people as I can. I lost a lot of money and way more than half the value of my BTC which I purchased at $9,428. I was devastated and got desperate seeking options to recover my loss when I stumbled upon James Long on youtube. After considering the odds, I contacted him via mail, and the result was life-changing. That's when I realized that it is ok buying loads of coins for a future that could moon or completely dip and cost you your Holding. Well, I couldn’t lose any further cos I wasn’t HODling again and I also chose to try out James Long's signals. He gave me a basic understanding of the benefit of trading over holding especially in a speculative market. He then provided me with his daily signals and trading patterns, and within a month, I was able to make almost 600% on my Bitcoins. James Long never asked me to give him access to my account, you can always join the winning team of a more experienced trader with already working and proven strategy. If you have any inquiries, you can reach him on *(jameslong241 @ Gmail. com)* and gain reliable profit with your little experience in crypto.",0

"Well Said, And to add, back in the massive 2017 into 2018 BullRun, when BTC was about $19K, the expert traders were telling noob investors to HODL & BUY. All while the experience traders were slowly liquidating there BTC, XRP, ETH etc., making massive gains. Only to eventually buy back on the cheap. I asked somebody why they give these noob holders bad advice, and there response was so the NOOBS won't crash the price by panic selling, and to give the experience traders a chance for huge returns.",0

activitity pub + cryptocurrency!,0
"It might be better to include some general terminology in the video title. Since I clicked on this video randomly, since I was bored and found it pretty interesting. But I had no idea what it was about before clicking. I think if it said ""Decentralized Social Media - Mastodon & The Fediverse Explained"" or something of the sort, I'd have been much more likely to click on it, since I have an idea what the video is about before clicking.  As currently, the video may as well have no title from the perspective of someone who doesn't know what Mastodon or the Fediverse is. Maybe the thumbnail could also be utilized to add the general terminology too.",0
Thanks a lot! The channel used to be about tech tutorials. Now it's more about explaining things I find interesting ;),0
"Wow, you are 100% correct! I've changed the title to what you suggested. It's way better! I should put a bit more time in coming up with a good title and thumbnail. Right now I mainly focus on the content, but as you pointed out: that's worth nothing if people don't click on it. Thanks again man! Really appreciate your feedback!",0
I don't see how this isn't scaring anyone else?,0
"It's very different compared to the Fediverse. Steemit is (in theory) completely decentralized as everything is stored in one single blockchain. Mastodon is different because each server has its own storage, it's not shared. On the other hand Mastodon is completely open source and there are many instances out there. Steemit on the other hand has just 1 ""instance"" (but with many people supporting the underlying blockchain).",0
"One of worst names is ""public key"" .. wtf? Why it's called key? It's more like ""public opened trezor"" .. once u put something in and close it, it can be opened only by it's owner with his private key ...",0
"That decentralized apps are great! But the problem is that there some  of them are still seperated. Some of them are Mastodon (and other compatible apps), ZeroNet, Steem... There are also many ""storage"" providers like Storj, OrbitDB, IPFS, 3Box, blockchains... And it is also same for identify services. All of them have some advantages and disadvantages so it would be great if they would be able to communicate and work with each other.",0
"Also, can I sign up on one Mastodon instance and then use my profile on another or on PeerTub?",0

"Exactly! The content is great and the title and thumbnail usually need to have the same care and consideration, since it's the first thing people see. You need to capture something relatable and that people can understand to incite interest, but not dumbing it down too much or being misleading. It can be difficult sometimes.",0

"I like the idea, but I'm not a fan of the current UI, and I don't like that I have to choose which instance I have to act as when boosting a post etc. For example, the full handles are too long to remember, and I'd like it to go to all instances.

"What meaning has the smart property concept for cars? Ok, car has it's own ID shared with the network (something like colored crypto coin) and the owner also knows the private key associated with it. ID is based on the digital certificate of manufacturer, so anybody can verify that the car was really produced. But, if somebody really steals my car (physically), how can anybody verify that he just don't exchange the public key (car ID) as it will looks ok? Not stolen? How can I securely say that this car has this ID in the blockchain?  I understand advantages of blockchain ""unchanbeability"", but tokenization of car keys to coins doesn't make sense.  Imagine this situation. You have the petrol station and stolen cars can't use it. With blockchain you can find the same car ID and verify, that it have to be unlocked with the owner's private key. How can you prove that this car has this ID?  I thought about giving some serious disadvages of no private key. Ok, you can still destory the immobilizer or something like that, but the property is still in the blockchain under the other owner (verified by the having of private key). How can it be used against theft?  Or how everybody can verify, that exactly this car has been stolen? That's smarter than attemping to prevent theft at all.  Just "" you don't have the private key, so you can't shopping there, you can't use this road, you can't park here, you can't get the insurance etc. Why? Because you're a thief! You don't have the private key of this car."" This may be the revolution in the security of property..  Example. I stole car without using the private key. Just because of power. I destoried the car computer and replaced it with my own. How can now anybody verify that the car is stolen using the blockchain?  Or, anyway, it is not important? Why? Maybe because you catch the thief before he changes the look of car. Imagine he rides on the highway and the security camera takes a picture.  If the car has permanent internet connection, the car's network node has to be turned off while violent theft (!). The car's look is in the blockchain associated with the car's ID (I know that it will probably takes too much memory, but imagine). So, now  can anybody (using the camera) deduce that this car has probably broken security system because it's ID loses touch with the vehicle and nobody types the passworld. So it has been stolen.  Of course, because of pseudoanonymity nobody knows who has the keys in the real world.",0

"IPFS has a great epic privacy fail!  IPFS is a solution to get content from an computer near you to protect the long range internet data link and to reduce the latency of respondig. Rearly a great Idea!  But if yo can find content on computer near you, you can also determninate on wat computers a specific content was seen. This is - depending on the content - enourmes privacy influencing.  The classic example: You are using products of the Adults Entertainment Industrie. Or you have see stuff, your goverment does not like you see ist. For example some Hints about Korruption of Erdogan in the Tukey. Or some History reports About the Amenias Holocaust in Turkey. Within the USA i dont know such exact, but looking Videos from Parties the USA is in War will it also create some Questions from Official sides?  To Bring IPFS to a success, it must include the privacy Ideas of IAN Clark's Freenet. For Example: the Chunks are Hashed, Then Encrypted with the Hash as Key and then a second time Hashed for Address creation. The Link is the concat of the both Hashes. This makes the Content Denieble. Wy there is a ""Privacy Mode"" in the Browser when you can look in the ipfs folder to check what was used?  But for Every Content you Know you can Calculate the Link. So the Data must be never stored at the related Computer to make IPFS rearly a private transport layer. And also it ist Important that the Content never comes direct from the source Computer. How to do this is all finaly evaluated in Ian Clark's Freenet. In Order to Avoid ""Cambridge Analytica"" by everyone, it is Madatory to include Ian Clarks privacy Ideas to IPFS  In its current form it is only siutabel for Operatind system Distribution.",0

"Most people don't realize that even if you delete your Facebook account, Facebook will still have ALL of your data. This is because, when you delete your account, the Fb database will simply mark it as ""Inactive"". In other words, there is likely a ""users"" table, in the Fb database, which contains a boolean (True/False) or binary (0/1) column, titled ""active""(or something similar). When you create a Facebook account, this column will either be set as ""True"" (boolean) or ""1"" (binary). When you delete your account, the boolean/binary value will simply be flipped (to either ""False"" or ""0""). This merely tells the Facebook program not to display the user's information any longer, since the account is no longer active.  However, all of your information (Profile, Media, etc) is still stored in the database, which Facebook can still utilize and sell, as it deems fit.",0
"- Bitcoin network is decentralised and it is true Peer-to-Peer system - Lightning network is centralised and is not Peer-to-Peer system - Bitcoin miners are not acting as money transferring entities, this is why they cannot be regulated - Lightning network uses Hubs which do act as money transferring entities, and have to be regulated  So in short, Bitcoin system is one that no bank or government can control or regulate while Lighting they can (and will).  When Bitcoin Core developers who are employees of corporation Blockstream, who are funded by bankers, give reasons as to why Bitcoin cannot scale on-chain, they are literally lying, an the real reason they are doing this (preventing increase of block size which is artificially kept by them at 1MB) is because the people that fund them (tens of millions of dollars) are the only people that have to lose (their power and control over supply of money) - the bankers.  Bankers have tried to kill Bitcoin as it is threat to their power and control. Bankers realised they cannot do this externally. Bankers then did what they always do, buy out people who have control of the code, and let them do the dirty work for them  Bitcoin Core developers have successfully prevented more scaling on Bitcoin layer, they use censorship and propaganda against anyone that exposes their lies and secret agenda (which I just outlined). Just head to r/bitcoin (heavily censored controlled by Blockstream associates and pro-Bitcoin BTC) and you will see what I mean.  The Bitcoin system is actually BSV  BTC is literally a SCAM now and no longer works as Bitcoin system should and Lightning has absolutely NOTHING to do with Bitcoin.",0

"I feel like the explanations are a bit over simplified, so here's my take on it.  There are 4 items: the document, a box, a lock, and a key.  The box is the encryption algorithm that uses the lock to encrypt the document and create the decryption algorithm.  The lock and key are the public and private keys. I call them the lock and key because of how they're used.  You have your sensitive document that needs to be sent, and your friend sends the box and key. The box is something that everyone can get and probably didn't need to be sent since you might already have one, but the lock is specific to your friend. You put your document in the box, lock it, and send it for them to unlock it.  Bam, I just summarized this in a way the included the actual algorithm and doesn't use the phrase ""public key.""",0

"Bitcoin Cash can process more transactions because nobody uses it, so it has capacity (for now). But Bcash can not scale until Visa because it would require a 100 GB block, which cannot be transmitted effectively every 10 minutes to all nodes. Lightning network is a long-term bet and it can truly scale without compromising security and decentralisation of the network. Bitcoin Cash is the wrong short-term fix.",0
You say Lightning Network risks centralisation but don´t mention that scaling on-chain is guaranteed centralisation? In Lightning you can choose whatever route you want and the protocol is private because each node can only see one hop so is unable to tell where did the payment come from or where is it going.,0

"@MR9 Production Yes, this is right. Or you might think of it this way: in order for the block to be valid, it's hash (which includes the nonce in its input) has to start with at least a certain number of zeroes, and so the miner is guessing different nonces (it doesn't necessarily have to be incrementing starting from zero, you could also just generate random nonces to try, which I believe is what actually happens) until it finds one that results in a block hash that satisfies that requirement.   Because the output of a hash function is more or less random, the chances that any given character in it is a specific number like zero is basically 1/16 (hashes are in hexadecimal, so 16 possible characters), which means on average you will have to try 16 nonces before you get a hash that starts with a zero (for example).  If you want it to start with two zeroes it should take about 256=16^2 tries with different nonces until you find one. A hashing function generally takes about the same amount of time to run every time, so if you have a certain length of time you want this process for generating a valid block hash to take, you can tune this by setting the difficulty -- the higher the difficulty (more zeroes at the beginning of your hash) the longer it will take on average to find one by randomly guessing the nonce.   So just by showing the block, the correct nonce you found, and the resulting block hash that satisfies the current difficulty, you've actually proven that you spent a certain amount of time working on this problem. Because of the way hashing algorithms work, there's no way to cheat this -- you really can only find a valid hash by guessing nonces and testing them out, you can't start with a hash with a bunch of zeroes and reverse the process to find the nonce that generates it. This relies on the fact that the hashing algorithm uses some specific math that is impossible to reverse for all practical purposes (for Bitcoin it's the discrete logarithm problem).  That's why this is called proof of work! The mere existence of the block hash proves that you did a certain amount of work, because you couldn't have it without doing the work (or at least *someone* had to do the work to create it). And the beauty of this system is that it's very easy to check that the hash is valid, because you only have to take the nonce they found and do one hash of the block yourself -- if it matches the hash they gave, then you know it's valid.  All of this proof of work stuff is important because it makes it very hard to modify the blockchain. In order to modify a block, you have to generate proofs of work for that block and every block after it (since each one depends on the previous one, as shown in the video). Since by design a proof of work takes a long time to generate, the further back the block is that you're trying to change the more time it will take to find all those new hashes. Meanwhile, the honest miners are continuing to add blocks to the original, unedited version of the blockchain. Unless you are in control of most of the miners you will never catch up.  This is why the rule is to always trust the longest version of the blockchain if there is more than one, because ultimately the honest blockchain will always grow longer than your edited version. This is also why you should wait for a certain number of ""confirmations"" before trusting a transaction (a confirmation is just another block added on top of the one containing your transaction) -- maybe the hacker got lucky and found a valid hash really quickly once or twice for their malicious blockchain, but the chances they can keep this up for 6 or more blocks is basically zero.",0
Nicely done Savjee.,0
This gave me a headache.,0
"I have a question: What exactly happens if I try to change data in an existing block? I understand that this will change the hash number and that the subsequent block will detect the change. However, does that mean that my changes are rejected by all other computers? That they are effective but can later be detected? Can I make such changes if I own 51% of the computing power? Please help, I need this for a presentation next week.",0

"There are a few factors, such as greater efficiency of PoS coins, its higher resistance against any kinds attacks as well as the growing popularity of this consensus which is dictated by a significant technological advantage over Proof of Work. That is why some currencies decide to conduct swap and resign from using PoW which is replaced by Proof of Stake. One of such coins is PrimeStone Coin (PSC) which conducted swap in January 2019. As a user I am more satisfied with PoS, because rewards for stakers come proportionally to the amount of possessed coins so it a fair solution. The situation with PoW was a bit confusing nd irritating. When sb put a huge comupting power and then switched it off, the chain was stuck. So I consider chains based on PoW less efficient and effective than PoS.",0
"Blockchain tehcnology is becoming more and more popular. A few years ago no one thought about the application of blockchain in banking or medical sectors. No one thought about studies with specialization in cryptocurrencies and blockchain. And now it is all true, present and real. Blockchain provides a wide range of possible applications but I think that lots of companies are not prepared for such a move. I came accross the blockchain project that will provide consulting and help with the application of  blockchain-based solutions in business. PrimeStone is a startup but they are also of the opinion that blockchain may provide much more than we can currently expect.",0
"It is a huge advantage of the currency if it has this feature. Some users focus on basic things like consensus or algorithm, but they forget that other coin features are extremely vital and should be taken under consideration when you choose a coin to invest in. I have invested in two currencies (PIVX and PSC) that use Zerocoin Protocol which improves the method of enabling private transactions. The underlying technology utilizes Zero-Knowledge Proof function. PIVX is known by everyone, but the PrimeStone Coin (PSC) is a quite new currency ""well-equipped"" with additional functions. Both coins are worth considering.",0
Symmetric encryption only uses one key that both parties must know to decrypt the message. The issue with Symmetric encryption is sharing the key with both parties without an eavesdropper finding out the key.

"""No process can access memory address outside its memory space"" this is correct but spectre is doing it by bypassing this mechanism. The speculative execution doesn't check for who's instruction it's speculating and who gave that instruction. It just checks what could be executed afterwards. The attacker could use this to make unauthorized changes in decisions that CPU makes. so the attacker doesn't lose time working against the kernel, instead he uses the permission the kernel gave to him.",0

"Mining...(proof of work) is old slow tech and has now been proven to be a liability....a weak point in any Blockchain. A situation called a 50% attack is a term that has now become a dirty word in the world of Crypto. And now it is a mad rush to move on from the Mining (proof of work) to Proof of Stake (POS).  With POS a person can stake some or all of their holdings, making more of that particular digital currency...thus making their holdings grow in a safer way than POW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As for centralization.....every digital currency and it's blockchain is centralized in the beginning. So, I really hate when people start saying how this project is centralized more than this other project.....as the digital asset becomes developed further down the line (road map) the goal is for the project to become Decentralized. So, that argument is a weak one at best. It just really depends on at what stage in the development process is a particular digital currency at, at the moment. We are so early to this asset class, we are at the beginning of the development of ""internet of value"" that most digital currency/blockchain are not even close to what they will be like in 10 - 20 years from now.",0

The error correction example you gave is completely bogus. Take your 5 7 and 19 example. Say you can only read the 5 and have an error correction of 31. That leaves 26 unaccounted for and two blanks to fill in. That then creates an array of potential values. So how then does one or the sequencer know which value is assigned to each blank? Also keeping in mind that the wrong value will alter the DNA and thus make the error correction of no value.,0
"Interesting, I wasn't aware of that.",0
"Hi Sean! Actually the example I gave is the most simple version of an error correcting code. This video was about DNA storage, not about error correcting code so I had to keep it short. It's possible to add more redundancy with more advanced ""algorithms"" like Reed-Solomon encoding. And you're correcting when you say that my explanation won't work when a wrong value is read.",0
"The problem with the approach you described is someone does not understand how DNA works.  There are two strands of data, likened to a male and female or positive and negative. The male/positive is the strand that is read and the female/negative is the strand that confirms the data is accurate.  Say each value in the strand is one of the following: 00, 01, 10, 11 and also holds up to 4 values or 8 digits (bits/bytes).  If the male/positive is 01, then the female/negative is 10; the exact opposite. Male 01, 01, 11, 00 & Female 10, 10, 00, 11 and totals has a total of 8 (11, 11, 11, 11). This yields two distinct strands that are complementary to each other and when totaled will always equal to 8. This also gives great error correction since any combined lines that have a total value of less than 8 one knows immediately that they have been tampered with or are incorrect, letting you know to perform error correction. Because both strands must be complementary all error correction is a simple math operation to recover. This is not hard nor very difficult, so long you one knows what they are doing.  Now on top of the basics, one could easily allow for new/different formats for various purposes, so long as they stick to the principles mentioned above. Change your total value from 8 to say 64 or 128, etc. It makes no difference other than some performance on massive data sets. Similarly one could nest the simple DNA strands within each other to make up massively complex DNA, similarly to nesting arrays within each other.",0
"@Simply Explained - One cannot talk about DNA storage without talking about error correction since that is the main benefit to DNA storage and also half of the story right there. See my second comment that accurately describes DNA storage. It also correctly shows how error correction is handled as it is vitally important to the DNA storage itself. No ""advanced algorithms"" are needed either unless one tries to make a mess out of the simplicity of DNA storage. But then that is a whole other beast.",0
"Interesting, thank you for the explanation! I must have completely missed this while doing my research. I found the DNA Fountain method which uses fountain codes. I therefore assumed that any error correcting code would do the job and explained the most simplest version of it. My bad! I'll pin your comment so people can read it first.",0

"If this drives down the cost of synthesizing arbitrary DNA, I wonder if that could lead to criminals seeding crime scenes with arbitrary DNA from many people who weren’t present, thus hiding their crimes. Or law abiding citizens obscuring their movements for privacy reasons by deploying large amounts of such DNA. Kind of like “chaff” - a countermeasure used by aircraft to confuse radar readings. This would be like biometric chaff. Though cheaper reading of DNA might offset this impact by making it easier to sort through.  In any case, it’s an interesting subject.",0

Wait. This still has some big flaws. Since hdd’s are the cheapest storage medium most of the data will be stored on it. Wich would make the internet slower again. And if you alter a pixel in an image this will just still be a new image wich would bloat the network.   And how would compression work on this network? We just all sending raw video files?   Also wouldn’t it be more sufficient to have a big cashing database on mars instead of distributing it. So you can have tiered storage wich would make the internet feel faster because the most visited sites are the most requested. And then to communicate with earth you could work with quantum entanglement since  distance doesn’t seem to matter with entanglement.,0

"I totally agree with you that there was a lack of explaination regarding the non-interactive zk-proof. Without knowing if it is correct, I see the non-interactive zk-proof as something that is easily tested for truth rather than using a process to convince. For instance in the case of the color blind guy with the green and red ball, in that case it was interactive as you had to prove that you could see a difference. Imagine if the green ball was made of some magnetic material and the red was non-magnetic, you could easily prove the balls were different without the testing back and forth. This is a fact you easily can share with many other in the same situation. I come to this conclusion as he says that blockchain have to use non-interactive proof to work and in the case with blockchains you don't have to show every nounce you where trying to show everyone you have a solution, only the last value that was a solution as it is a very easy computation for everyone to to test if it is true. I do see this is 100% sure though, and he keeps saying that with zk-proof you can never be 100% sure. I can't fit that part into my reasoning for non-interactive zk-proof...  Would this be a plausible explaination?",0

Hi one thing I didn't understand: Why would a hacker recalculate the other blocks after tempering a block? At first I thoguht it was about finding a hash collision but it seems something else is at play here. thanks,0
its possable after 100 years,0
"When you change something in a block, the hash changes. And when that happens all blocks after that one become invalid. So you have to tamper with them all.",0

"@Simply Explained Hi, thanks so much for replying. By ""sucessor blocks becoming invalid"" I think you mean the pointer points to an non existent block now, making the entire successor block invalid. You mean to say the hacker would fix this problem by changing the pointer to the newly generated hash code of the tempered block thus generating a new hash for the sucessor?That sounds to me like lots of effort, but assume someone manages it after a long time. The hacker now has a completely newly generated block chain as his own local copy. Now what? That copy is different from anyone elses...Basically I don't understand why a hacker would change his entire local block chain when his local copy ends up being different from the rest of the world",0

"Really great, that sparked a great idea in my mind! :) (y)",0
"Yes, that's exactly what I mean. As you say: this is designed to be very hard and require a lot of effort. The reason is simple: in a Blockchain network there has to be consensus. This is reached when 50% of all nodes on the network have the exact same copy of the blockchain. (Note that you can have a tampered version of the blockchain. Thats possible, but nobody will look at yours).  Back to the hacker. If it would be easy to tamper with blocks, he could convince 50% of the nodes on the network to conspire with him. In the end, they could steal a lot of coins and reap the profits. So that’s why breaking a blockchain is deliberately made difficult.",0

Well the circuit converts the AC output of the CT sensor into a completely positive one (going from 0V to 2V). Then the emonlib library counts the cycles and calculates how much current is going through it. Emonlib is actually where the magic happens.,0
Me too! I recently got into programming microcontrollers and it's so much fun (but also very time consuming). I also have a project with an e-ink display. Might do a video on that one as well. Depends on how people like this video.,0

There's not much you can do. You can use a browser like Brave or extensions like Privacy Badger to limit the amount of tracking cookies set on your system. But you can't get completely rid of them. They're used by so many websites/companies.,0
"Simply Explained - Savjee I bought a few CT sensors as well a few years back, but the incoming wires are actually too wide for the sensors. However I noticed that we have a LED flashing 10 000 times for each kWh on our energy meter, so I’m thinking of using a D1 mini (a tiny Arduino-like board) with a photo resistor. That microprocessor will then report to a Home Assistant instance. I might write a blog post if you’re interested?",0

How much does AWS IOT cost monthly,0
"It has a very generous free tier. This setup doesn't cost me anything. That includes AWS IOT but also DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda and S3",0
You are correct. These sensors can't detect current with a regular appliance cord because the current going in one wire is going out the other wire in the other direction. These opposing currents null out each other. You could make a short extension cord that has the two wires and then put the clamp over one of the wires. Given the crap  I have lying around that's how I'd do it.  A cool little trick for measuring low currents is that you can wrap the wire you put the sensor through the sensor several times and then divide the resulting measurement by the number of loops you did.,0
"Hey nice work! Im planning on doing a similar project on my channel soon. You bet I'll take a look at your code!    A small correction though at 5:22 I think you meant apparent power. You cant reliably measure true power without taking into account the voltage, it should be fairly easy for you to implement this using a voltage transformer.",0

"I've built my own on a solder board using an arduino nano. Problem is I have to poll it using python/serial and inject into influxdb. My next version is going to be the esp32 as well.

I love the idea of the usage over time in the way you store the data and figure out the ""Always On"" devices and account for them.   To get real voltage, you could add AC circuit that reads the voltage directly, then rectifies and outputs to power the esp. But you'd need to have an AC power brick, as the DC ones have been smoothed and/or are done digitally with no transformer. On my line, over the course of a day, my voltage can swing from 125VAC to 116VAC (US power), which can make big difference on power consumption.

"How is it possible? Off-line is not creating a public key until you go on-line. So, i can't understand.",0
"👍🏻👍🏻 finally, we have to make more easier to use many people, it’s massadoption.",0
"If the wallets can be created offline, then is there a possibility that the private address of wallet will not have a duplicate when someone around the world generates his own wallet ?",0
Why would being offline prevent you from creating a key pair? These algorithms work on your system.,0
"I get ""Dynamo is assigned but value is never used"" ???",0
"Generating a public/private keypair is just a bunch (it really is a lot) of math, which you can do on any computer, online or offline. You could even do it by hand, but that’s just insane.",0
Yes it will ‘create’ it offline. All public and private keys are already out there. The only thing you do is randomly choose one and the pub and priv get combined to form your wallet. Therefor you dont need to be online in order for it to be ‘created’. Correct me if im wrong here but this is how i thought it works.,0
"The wallet being created offline or online is exactly the same process. There is no check if the address exists or not. The generation of private keys and their according public keys is just the same as rolling a bunch of dice. You can do this online or offline, and someone else can roll the same dice. The difference is that the chance of rolling the same dice as someone else is just astronomically low, like you’d spend more time than the age of the universe to find two that match up, which is called a hash collision.",0
"Good video as usual, but I would mention that public keys should not be reused to reduce the ability to follow coins (see ‘change address’ for more info) and that most wallets do this by default.",0
"Even if generating duplicates is astronomically low probable, but it is possible right ?. Then how is it safe",0
"Very cool, I didn’t know that was how it worked. Excellent explanation, as always. Thanks for sharing!",0
"Just out of curiosity, what is the math behind potential wallet collisions (the probability that you would randomly generate the same key pair as someone else)?",0
@Ram Ganesh Soma  Think about the private key as huge number which is randomly generated. So if my random number is the same as yours I can steal your coins. There is no system to prevent this. It's just that the probability is astronomically low. To understand how low it really is watch the first result on Youtube if you search: 256 bit security,0
"The fact a person or individual can artificially inflate the value of the coin, by sending coins to a non-existent ""wallet"", should be a major red flag. Also in the case of illegal activities, what is to stop a person from destroying any evidence by destroying the coins and wallet so as not to be caught? Especially if they also find a way to artificially create the ""non-existent"" wallet they sent the coins to be destroyed, therefore re-gaining all the coins they ""lost"". This setup allows for the ""perfect crime"" since the individual can destroy all traces of evidence and then gain it back minus any trail.  Digital currencies may work but just like anything new, there are still bugs to sort out, mostly how people can and will abuse what is already there to do more than was intended. IMHO it should be impossible to send anything or transact with a wallet that does not exist. Also wallets themselves should be required to be validated by peers the same way the currency transactions are. This would help close a large loop and potential major security issue. The public ledger must be used for the wallet creation as well. Period.  The other thing is that a public ledger is of little value without being able to know for certain how is witness to which transactions. Consider a malicious person wishes to abuse the system, so they create their wallet and several others. The others then become their own personal witness to some transactions, supposedly giving validity to the transaction. Yet all they have done is setup a dummy wall around the transaction to conceal it from being flagged. How would any person know if in fact it is a valid transaction or not. This again also should be thought of in light of the above, an individual who abuses the current setup. Too little record keeping is the main issue and perhaps was left in intentionally. If banks that have been around forever would not operate in such a manner, then a wise person should logically ask themselves why would digital currency do away with what works? Just because you can do something does not signify that it is good to do it. They desired to have more animosity, yet that may well be the achilles heel. Time will tell..  IMHO digital currency was created to strip value from legitimate users and provide a means for illegal activities. This then ensures that the majority of valid legitimate users serve as the perfect cover for the illegal activities that go on. Reality is the fundamental changes made for digital currency is the issue. No one speaks of this, as if none can write any programs that will abuse the software ever, nor will they ever try to do so.

Great content.  But a question. I know mathematically it is much > than winning the lottery but it seems like you could have a computer program auto generating wallets using a 12 word recovery phase and checking the balance.

Very cool project! Can I use it on a power bar (which has 3 wires insulated) for example? or only on the hot wire of the entire house?,0
this is how encryption basically works..,0
Can you explain how mnemonics work?,0
"Hi Wim! Long time no see ;)  Yes, you're right. However, I don't know if it should've been mentioned here. I only wanted to explain the mechanics of creating wallets and making transactions.",0
"How are paper wallets insecure? Yes, a thieve could physically steal them. But the same is true for hackers with digital files.",0
"You don't have to ""show"" your private key. It is only used to put a digital signature on your transaction. This signature allows people to verify that it came from the person with the correct private key. BUT it can't be used to recreate your private key.",0
"Wow, I understand crypto currency now, thanks! This is probably the simplest explanation of the concept I've ever seen.",0
Glad you understood it with this video!,0
"Coin burning is sometimes a good thing (especially to get rid of undistributed coins after an ICO) but I agree with you that it should not be used to inflate the value. But this is not unique to cryptocurrencies. Artificial inflation is happening right now, as central banks believe that it's necessary to maintain growth.  Small note: ""coin burning"" doesn't mean ""to destroy coins"". It simply means that you send them to a wallet of which nobody can obtain the private key. So you can't use this mechanic to perform ""the perfect crime"". The coins are still there and there is a record of you transferring coins to it. Also: there is no point in transferring your crime money to a wallet of which you cannot obtain the private key.  I don't agree that the creation of wallets should be changed. It's part of what makes cryptocurrencies so flexible (and also so secure). You can essentially hold coins and send transactions while being completely airgapped or without access to the internet.  About your witness statement: in most blockchains each transaction is still verified by the entire network, so it's pretty hard to beat that system. Other systems have special algorithms to randomly select a smaller amount of people to verify your transactions (which in theory you can't influence). Also: each transaction on a blockchain is digitally signed and this signature can be used to verify that the transaction originated from the person who has the private key of a wallet. So that's pretty secure as well. But I do agree with you that most software has flaws that can be exploited. Nothing is perfectly secure.  As for your comment about ""stripping value from legitimate users"": it depends. I do indeed see quite a few projects that are only interested in grabbing as much money as they can. Other projects really aim to build a replacement to our fiat currencies. Can it be used for criminal activities? Yes. But that's also the case with currencies today.  (Small disclaimer: I'm not trying to convince you or change your mind. I just want to offer a more detailed explanation & add some context)",0
"There is a small section on the Bitcoin wiki talking about it: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_version_1_Bitcoin_addresses Basically the chance is incredibly small. Mind you, it's still possible. Just highly unlikely.",0
I'm gonna say it again: Paper wallets are obsolute.  use BIP39 mnemonic seeds.,0
"Bitcoin doesn't do encryption. Nothing is encrypted in the bitcoin network. It uses public key cryptography to do digital signatures, not encryption.",0
"you know windows has a NSA backdoor? Windows itself is not secure. Use a hardware wallet like trezor, or make HD wallet somewhere secure and write down your seeds words.",0
@Simply Explained paper wallets are obsolute. Use BIP39 mnemonic seeds. You can also write those words down which is much more secure than paper wallets. You shouldn't use a address more than once.,0
you broadcast your digital signature. Not your private key.,0
A very dumbed down video with out-to-date practices. Bitcoin is not what it was in 2009.,0
But these seeds are used to generate the keypair that is associated with a wallet. So how is this so much different compared to what I've been saying? You can print out your Mnemonic sentence and you'd have another version of a paper wallet.,0
Can you point out how Bitcoin wallets have evolved since 2009? Don't they use a public/private keypair anymore? Is that what you're saying?,0
@Simply Explained I'd say HD wallets with BIP39 mnemonic seed should have had emphasis.,0

"@SAL I studied some more... I actually got more worried, not less. I'm convinced LN will work with full custodial services, but in that case it's not really that different from using a bank. A bank is useful, but just as a regular bank one day you might just find out your bank is insolvent.  It can work for advanced users, which are willing to invest in running a full node, but that use case doesn't look too promising to me.  It is just not going to work for ""regular users"" on a non-custorial way, because on crappy user hardware it's too easy to lose the latest state of the channel.  Lastly if it's expensive to open and close channels, those expenses are going to have to be repassed to users hiring the custodial service.  Lastly, I'm not yet convinced once LN starts to see having heavy use, it's not gonna have tons of liquidity and deadlock problems on routes. Did I mentioned that opening and closing routes might still be pretty expensive?",0
"@Diogo V. Kersting LN *can* work with custodial services, just like how a blockchain setup can - but in either case, that doesn't mean it has to work with custodial services.  In other words, users can still be their own banks while using lightning.  It is already possible to manage your own lightning channels on an SPV node on your own smart phone (which is the only hardware that's needed in such a setup).  The channels can be managed automatically by the wallet software.  The latest state of any channels can be backed up in any number of ways (using a node running at home, a cloud service, a watchtower service, etc).  To address potential liquidity problems, we are already seeing the development of non-custodial ""loop-in"" and ""loop-out"" services.  As for ""deadlocks"" during routing, it isn't a big problem and it is very easy for the wallet software to immediately try a different route.  I have been using lightning for over a year now, and some of my channels have remained open since then.",0

Bitcoin is a unit of account and its current price represents the current capitalized value of the network that is resides on.

Likewise with silver, although it tarnishes easier than gold. Stability, probably more than any other quality, is prized in currency and stores of value, and that's why Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency's) volatility makes it anathema to being adopted widespread. That volatility, though, is what makes it attractive to people looking to make a quick buck, so it may be a while before it settles down.",0

"It's less volatile than a lot of world currencies, though. Here in North America and Europe we're a little spoiled with our stability. It's also very easy to transport (even across borders) and has other perks that Gold, Silver and fiat just don't have.   Ex: If I need to buy something for $15000 in cash (like a boat), what are my choices? The bank limits me to $2500 per day, so I can wait a week and get them to get my cash ready. Or I can do a cheque... which has similar clearing times. Or I can do an eTransfer... which also has daily and weekly limits. So I should pay by credit card?... which also has fees. Honestly, it doesn't feel like I have much immediate control over ""my"" money.   Crypto though - login, enter receiver's address, click button. A few moments later the funds are transferred and the network makes it irreversible. You can do it on the spot with the goods in front of you, then take ownership of them.   It's not for nothing that banks are looking into how to implement positive crypto traits into their own systems. It's superior!...",0
"Digital fiat money unfortunately hands all control over to the government and businesses. Crypto does not. Oh, something unruly is happening in.. Seattle?

"Yet, we need to put our trust in something in order to exchange goods. Yes, nothing has intrinsic value unless we decide it has it including gold and diamonds. Great content tho! Thumbs up",0
Easy & Well explained !!!!,0
"Xavier, If a currency do not have a backing from govt and is not regulated then it will not have any value. I think bitcoin is like a ponzi scheme. It will collapse when there are only sellers and no buyers.",0
"Yep, they don't have any value. However, I wouldn't call it a Ponzi scheme. In the case of Bitcoin there is no guarantee that you'll earn money. It's a free market where supply and demand is matched up. And yes, this market will collapse when nobody wants it anymore. But this is the same for 'regular' currencies as well.",0
"You're right! We have to trust currencies, otherwise we have no way of storing value for future use. Oh, and thanks for the kind words ;) not sure everyone appreciates a video like this 🙈",0

"@Simply Explained I agree. However   I think a responsible independent  ""democratic"" govt will make sure that their currency will not go out of value. Betting too much on bitcoin as a currency is a utopian dream, that will only last when everything is going well in the world.",0

Hey can you tell me instead of giving values to min&max in api can i give parameters?,0
Great tutorial! thnx bro,0
Thank you. Explained clearly.,0
"How is the smart contract separated from mining and the need for computer power(freeing up energy for processing transactions), but still part of the blockchain?",0
"So if there are at least 51% of the peer can control the network, then the peer can 'force' to temper block and make everyone in concensus?",0
Please make a video on pos blockchain creation,0
"Not necessarily.  51% doesn't mean you have the power to change the consensus rules.  We saw this play out in bitcoin in 2017 when over 70% of miners tried to do a hardfork change, but the users prevented them from doing so.",0
"In pending Transactions, all blocks are considered valid. At what case will they be false and not added to the chain?",0
"At @8:25, what does  console.log(JSON.stringify(savjeeCoin,null,4)); do? What is it's function? Btw, the video's great👌",0

You forgot the part where hackers steal all your bitcoin.,0
How to find hash,0
"Anything which has masses behind it is   credible and powerful. But in our current social structure we have given this authority to our governments. So unless a government backs it,  Its useless.",0
Agree. Getting ready to take mine. The more I read the more confusing it is for me. But this video just explained it all. I am no. Longer confused.,0
I can recover it for you,0
top man,0
the balance i get is 90 but my chain valid is false i double check isChainValid  this is the one i am making a false result  if(currentBlock.previousHash !== previousBlock.hash){                 return false;             } did i miss something?,0
just copy your node_modules from the earlier savjee tutorials to the new ones,0
copy paste your  earlier src folder to the new savjee folder. it should be '/src/blockchain' in the import,0

Valid argument. True to the core,0
Ugh 🤭 I still don't get it,0
Mining isn't necessary for a functioning blockchain,0
This sounds like an money service business,0
Great video! You just saved my day1,0
how is this different from tables in a database that  use primary keys,0
"Hello, where we can find your code for the application in ionic app ? Thanks very much ;) I really want to rebuild this tool for monitoring my home but I am newbie ;) do you write in the future a complete guide with all details and code to do it ? Thanks very much",0
Salt is stored seperately alongside the password..,0
The signature on the transactions are checked when they are entered into a block. This is what causes them to be rejected.,0
"This function takes a JSON object and formats it to be displayed on screen. The parameter ""4"" is to indicate how many spaces should be used to indent.",0
Great explanation! Haha now here is my prediction: someone participating in a poll about illegal activity will get charged with a crime by a law enforcement agency that interpreted the database at face value (i.e. Bob admitted he committed burglary) whereas Bob's answer was just randomly generated.,0
Well done. Thanks,0
Excellent performance I am really inspire pursue it sir.,0
Nice to implement this in the coming American elections,0
"If you ever get bored, you should create another channel explaining very simple things in very complicated terms! haha! Seriously, good video!",0
Can someone tell me how it will handle when the 2 nodes send the new block at the same time how the miner will act?,0
How about Privacy ?,0
Or you could just use XRP and the payment will be made and settled before the coffee is even poured for fractions of a penny transaction fee.,0
"hi, I just wanna thank u for ur nice video and i wanna ask u about the data u hashes just now, can i retrieve it without the need to break it or tamper with it or tamper with its hash?? since it is known that the blockchain is a distributed ledger and it is possible to store data in it, so how can i access that data if i already hashed it?",0
Awesome explanation !!!,0
This looks similar to linked lists in Data Structure with added security!,0
"First to broadcast to ""51%"" of the network wins",0
"The rest of the miners will build on which ever block they received first - because chances are the block they saw first is likely the same block the rest of the network saw first as well.  The block that isn't mined on top of gets tossed away, this is called an ""orphaned block"".",0

"I clearly showed how the hash function is used for this purpose. Changing content, changes the hash and everyone will notice that.",0
"@Savjee, Sorry to say I failed to grab the  comment 'After 2016 blocks the difficulty is recalculated but the code only looks at the first 2015' . Here what is the meaning of 'first 2015'. as per my knowledge the difficulty level is reevaluated after every 2016 blocks, that’s roughly after every 2 weeks. So, why 2015...??",0
"That's is the bug! Satoshi wanted to look at 2016 blocks, but the code doesn't look at the last one. A simple oversight on his part, but luckily with minimal impact.",0
"@Simply Explained You said it was a new block, no hash to check as it is the first one. How do they know it's a good one, it's new. I was left with more questions than answers. Who creates the hash.   How can I make legitimate changes to the blockchain if the hash cannot be changed. Who (specifically) approves changes to the hash. How does the new hash become part of the block chain. How often is the blockchain updated with the new or modified hashes. Thew way you describe it it's nearly impossible to make changes to the block chain.   I am not being fair. This is a very basic overlook of block chain.

"The situation you describe can happen, yes! To prevent fraud, many people choose to add a digital signature as well (see PGP Signature). This signature is computed by using the private key of the sender and the message content.

"@ParmuTownley ; If the client has to choose between two chains. It will choose the chain with the highest cumulative difficulty. So for example if there is a chain with three blocks, each having 200 of difficulty, and another chain with five blocks having each 30 of difficulty, the first one will be picked.  It can prevent attackers to mine a longer chain with artificially lower difficulty in order to get the longest one and to be accepted by the network as the ""true"" chain. Also, it's very unlikely that two concurrent chains have the same cumulative difficulty. It's so unlikely that the problem will probably never happen. Having two chains of the same length though, is much more likely.",0

"Thanks for the overview. It's disappointing that the FileCoin folks felt the need to build their own blockchain, even though it's understandable, seeing as the people in control of the main Bitcoin repository refused to allow the network to scale. (Even Ethereum itself may have been built on top of Bitcoin, if the Core developers hadn't shunned anyone who was trying to actually use the chain, and crippled it so that it was as un-useful as possible.) Now that there's Bitcoin Cash, I can only hope someone will build FileCoin-like infrastructure around BCH instead.",0

"Mimi B-L I can explain that.  The DAO had a vulnerability that allowed people to do something multiple times without a variable being set. Basically, the DAO did this:  (Dao Function) { Check for true Unsafely transfer ether Set check to false }  In Ethereum, when you send a regular transaction to a DApp, it triggers a function. That was what the attacker used.  He took out some ether to a smart contract. The attacker smart contract, when the transaction was sent said ""Hey, trigger that same function again""  So because the setting of the cooldown came AFTER the action, he withdrew again. The attacker did this hundreds of times, until it ran out of gas.",0
"Nakamoto cannot generate more Bitcoins. He'd have to go through the regular mining process, because in these decentralized blockchains everyone is equal.  You can verify my claim because Bitcoin is open-source, so if you see the code it has no special section saying ""Nakamoto can make more Bitcoins!"". The code IS the currency, so there isn't some sort of secret code or other stuff.",0
"The blockchain cannot directly distribute electricity, as it's like trying to mail a box through email, or trying to send an email through a water stream.  But you can pair blockchain with outside technology and make an electricity distribution system or something.",0

But if what you mean is like an app can't tamper with outside stuff, then sure. Or you're throwing around technology words you found on an article.  iOS already does all the work for you, you have to grant it permission to even look at your things. Android is a bit trickier, it's more free and more vulnerable. Windows, you'd need to write an app or use another app to permission your app. Mac, basically like Windows.",0

"@Keyshell if you have the private key to make a mathematically valid digital signature for a transaction, then everything works out as expected.  Now if you tried to sign without that private key, it would not be a mathematically valid signature.  Such fake transactions would be instantly noticed by the nodes of the network and disregard, and if by some chance it is included in any block, that block is immediately noticed to be invalid and it will not be included in the blockchain.  All nodes on the bitcoin network are checking every bit of data.",0

"I understand the odometer example but I don't understand the effectiveness of the food-tracking or shipment-tracking example. Because when nodes/participants in the blockchain ""verify"" the ""transaction"" they don't necessarily know what has actually happened - whatever the ""transaction"" is, just ""becomes"" when its verified and consensus is achieved. So isn't there still a risk here? Yes, the blockchain may be a faster tracking tool, but it doesn't make sure, that the initiated entry is correct in any way, am I right? If i'm right, I don't see it solve the presented problem = proving where it (e.g. the food) came from. Because that all depends on the first entry.",0

"IMO, using Asymmetric keys for data transfer is more complex esp. in Client server model. So, asymmetric encryption is just to exchange ciphers, certificate and server public key to client. Once shared, client generate a per session symmetric key using strong random generator and encrypt with server provided public key and send to server. After that, that symmetric key used to encrypt data for that session. This process repeat for every flows.",0

So glad I found this tutorial! I've been wanting to learn blockchain and this tutorial gave me a  glimpse of it. Very helpful. You earned my subscription for that.   Though I have a very minor clarifications though. Why is it that you invoked calculateHash() inside addBlock() where in fact calculateHash() is already been initialized to the 'Hash' property in the Block constructor? I cannot think of any reason why there's a need to re calculate the Hash in the addBlock() method.   Can you explain why? Thanks in advance! :),0
Some checks I put in the video aren't necessary and have been removed from the Github repository.   The main reason I did it is because in a P2P system you always have to check what you receive from other peers. They could've tampered with the block.   But as you point out: in this system (without P2P) it makes no sense.,0

so it's basically a linked list?,0
"gold was always being used in the industry, because there is no cheaper equilavent of it's properties.  low melting point, easy to shape, stable and non toxic etc... you may get gold and make a tool for human use, which would be impractical to make from other elements.   if someone needs it, might be ready to pay you by food to get that tool. this gives the intrinsic value of gold.   the rest of the value comes from being rare and bull market. shininess has a very small portion in it's value.   for ex; people use gold for dental prosthesis, because it's a statue symbol today. but until a generation ago, it was really required. immune to corrosion, mimics the hardness of a real teeth. simply there was no cheaper equilavent to replace it. people needed it for medical reasons. not just to show off.    even today, if we stop using gold or just remove gold from the earth, we may not have this micro processors anymore, cannot even mine crypto currency. we are using gold inside our microprocessors, because of it's conducting capabilities and there is no cheaper equilavent of this.  if we use only copper in microprocessors, it will generate much more heat and may melt itself down. I can show you billions of people, would be ready to pay by food or real estate for  having a microprocessor which built properly with gold conductors.    so I recommend you, be careful while talking about gold doesn't have any intrinsic value.",0
"why don't we need to take account of the nonce in checking the validity of the blockchain in this example? Otherwise, someone may easily tamper the data in the blockchain and re-calculate the hash of every block in the blockchain rapidly.",0
"Yep, with some security built in",0
Many of the points you make are correct. I did say that gold has interesting properties and that those make it more 'valuable' compared to other materials.   The point I wanted to make is that currencies have no real value. All of us are keeping this idea alive (and for good reason).  I definitely didn't want to say that gold is useless everywhere.,0

@Simply Explained - blockchain solutions can be closed (not readable) as well!  For example a voting application would in fact be public (writable) but closed (unreadable).   It has to be closed to maintain confidentiality.,0
Nice video and gives some good ideas of business use cases.  Just one comment however not all blockchain solutions will be public and open.  Depending upon the actual business need they could be open or closed.  Also they could be public or private.  There's little consensus (pun intended) around terminology but I'm using; open/close for the readability of the data and public/private to define who can write the data.   Ethereum technologies tend to offer open / public solutions and Hyperledger private / closed.,0

One is serving other code/applications while the other is serving users.",0

"Amazing, very informative video.",0
What website do you use to look at the current and ongoing hashrates?,0
"The 10minutes only apply to mining. This happens just once per block. After this is done, validation is extremely quick. So every 10minutes miners compete against each other to mine the next block. Why can you make fast transactions? Well most websites require a certain amount of validations before releasing your funds and this can be anywhere between 0 and 10minutes (depending on when the next block is mined and whether or not your transaction got added to it)",0
😬 A great colleague gave me the idea 👌,0

"Judging by the way the hash codes are generated, and how validation works, not really.  For the example in the video, hash codes are demonstrated to be utterly unique in order to act as a primary key for identifying a block. By changing a block's hash, you don't invalidate the block, you just give it a new identity. Now, this becomes important because as part of a block's validation process it must look at the block before it to ensure a consistent chain. In this case, B2's hash is changed, so when B3 looks for its previous link, B2, it can't find it because the hashes are different. B2's unique hash is *different* from *B3's memory* of B2's unique hash.  So why does this make B3 and subsequent blocks invalid, not B2? Well, the validation requires that *all* links of the chain remain consistent until they find the original, B1. In the example, B2 could still find B1. B1's hash didn't change. B3 however, couldn't find B1 because it couldn't find B2. And if B3 can't find B2, B3 can't find B1. This goes on for every block after B3 aswell. Ergo, B4 can find B3, but if B3 can't find B2, then B4 can't find B1.",0

"Nice job.  only one question. In your codes, as I checked, you set previous Hash by creating a block. Suppose that, ""L"" is the current last block in a chain. Block ""A"" and ""B"" are created at the same time. So they set their previous hash with the same hash e.g. Hash of ""L"".  What happens by mining when both of them are mined successfully, but B was mined faster.   Therefore normally the previous hash of ""B"" is correct, but the previous hash of ""A"" should be changed to the hash of ""B"".  What I want to reach, I think assigning previous hash by creating a block is not necessary, but by mining. Am I right?",0

"Amazing explanation. One thing I fail to understand is the hash system. Is that a simply a random crypto code? What keeps one from simply copying the hash and validating it that way?

"Oh, I get it! The for-loop calculates the hash as well! So it can only really match with either the current block or the next block, but never both!

"@pavan Kumar Yes that's true for past blocks. But when you're mining a new block you are the one generating it, so you have to come up with a nonce for the new block on your own. And that requires guessing and checking over and over until you find a nonce that works -- every miner is doing this at the same time so it's a race to see who finds a working nonce first. And whoever does gets to claim the block reward, which for Bitcoin is currently 12.5 BTC for every block, but it goes down over time.   As for the difficulty, it is automatically tuned by the Bitcoin protocol itself. At a set interval (about every two weeks), the protocol checks the average time it takes to add a new block and increases or decreases the difficulty to try to bring that average closer to the target time (10 minutes for Bitcoin). So that is a completely automated process.",0

"I think I read that the minimum POS for ETH is 32 ETH.  Right now it's at $226 USD, so I would have to sink $ 7,232 just to become a validator.  This seemingly is NOT a way for the average cryptopeep to gain entry.  I could continue buying enough to be ""competitive"", e.g., 50 ETH for $ 11,300 USD.  But do the validators know what the total number of validators in the group?     So then, I have 50 of my ETH in the stake ""bank"" but the big money have a lot more and I get nothing in return.  I haven't seen a contract form that will guarantee I will get my 50 ETH back, or that the POS could get hacked, etc. Even if everything is working fine, my ETH is locked up until ETH releases it.  If ETH price drops 50%, I can't sell.  Definitely looks too risky for me but not for the whales who could probably take a Capital Loss on their US income tax.  LOL    Excellent video, BTW.",0

I feel that misses the purpose of the Decorator Pattern where you dynamically extend an existing class without need to adjust that existing class. And a decorated Tesla should result in a Tesla again. I would adjust the naming a bit, eg DecoratedCar instead of CarOptions  abstract class DecoratedCar extends Car {      car : Car;      public abstract getDescription() : string      // the abstract cost() method is not required here as that one is inherited from Car }  class RearFacingSeatsCar extends DecoratedCar {       car : Car;               // might be the base car model or an already decorated car",0

"Everyone are saying that bitcoin and this blockchain are safe. If we are going to use the internet nothing is safe, the government has total control over the net. Every time you try to use it against the new government you will be shut down, think about this before you invest in any thing that uses the internet.

"What I don't get is how they (Public Key and Private Key )cannot derive from  each other.  For example : If I send to Stewie ""1 2 3 "" and his Public key transform my message to:  "" 2 3 4  "" (add +1 to each value ). Then , someone (Brian) who has Stewie's Public Key, won't need his Private in order to decrypt it .  I mean if he (Brian) has his(Stewie's) Public key , he can see the algorithm and he can pretty much do the opposite to decrypt it .  In this case he will make an algorithm that does [-1 to each value], so it will take ""2 3 4"" and decrypt my message to him. The basic question here is how We can go from Plain Message -> Encrypted Message (Using Stewie's Public key) but we cant do the opposite . How the Public Key can Encrypt a Message a certain way that it cannot Decrypt it after?",0

"For those die hard moron fans, read through and I hope this will help you wake up a bit. Yes Cardano may indeed be a promising project and I have no doubt good things will come out of it but when it comes to its leader it is a complete disaster. There is a reason why Charles Hoskinson is hated by absolutely everyone who has ever worked with him, he is one of the most toxic people to be around of. How hypocrite can one be to come ask for more funding to finish the project when he has sold ICO funds when BTC was at the top, to be more precise their ICO funds were around 110,000 BTC. When selling at the top that was more than 400 million dollars, moreover, Hoskinson assigned himself 2.4 billion ADA. All of the research IOHK ever made including Hydra, IELE and KEVM research was funded by ICO money, now after three years of incompetency and failed attempts to get something to market this man dares to come and ask the Cardano community for more funding in order to finish the initial roadmap. First he removed IELE and KEVM now they removed Hydra from saying it is not necessary, hell no Charles, it was always part of the roadmap. How low can you go to act this way, after all the money you earned from this project. Three years you lied to your community, telling them Shelley is just about to be delivered and now you act like none of this shit happened, it is disgusting the way you act knowing there is no one to be accountable to.

I changed your implementation to make it so that a list of contributors' addresses are stored in the block along with how many hashes they calculated, which is used to divvy out the rewards.

I feel like there must be a more efficient way of getting the balance than looping through the whole chain... maybe getting your balance could be a special type of transaction, and if the code finds that, it could know that that's the most recent updated balance and just stop there?",0

"To be honest, interface is nothing. It's just a way of saying something that means many things, exactly like the word 'drone', it means a continuous humming sound and yet it also means it's a named as well. That's where ignorance lies, yes from you people of today who have made words that make no sense whatsoever. How does something become whatever it means, and then it means many other things when the crappy word is already a known word, 'inter', as in interior, and face, as in a person's face, a door face, a car face, etc. Typical mixture of words that are already used to mean one logic when we talk and write. But to mix one known word with another is really confusing. And this interface is one of such confusing jargon added in the English literature that is going to cause problems, given that you already explained what it means. At first I had no idea what interface meant. I thought it means the image you see on a computer screen, e.g. like that of a software of which you work on, for example like Blender Foundation. But no, now you say that interface is a connection of a device to another device by cables, flash drive external drive, DVD drive, HDM to TV, etc. Waste of Time learning computer jargon in my opinion. If I am to connect a device to another device,  I just say, cables - as in HDMI cables, flash stick or usb drive cables, printers and other computer devices cables, each has a name for the connection of any devices, and cables, flash drives, etc., aren't interfaces. So, it's just the same with computer geeks, using words to make an unusual name for something that makes no sense whatsoever. The same with 'drone', it's a word that has present and past participles, one plural word and a number of definitions. So, how does it become a name to call shitty rc models and aircraft drones? Have you ever heard of names, such as John, Peter, Phillip, Stan, Mark, etc., ever had present/past participles and definitions? No, so, how does a word become a name, not just a name but how can it be used to name more than a dozen gadgets, including several flying pilotless military aircraft that the ignorant stooges call them UAVs? I mean how does an aircraft flown by a pilot become unmanned when the word 'unmanned' is not used for aircraft? If it is a female pilot, would you say 'unwomanned'? Does it make sense?  The word is only used for manned and unmanned land vehicle, not for aircraft. But the unbelievable illiterates of today think 'unmanned' is applied to aircraft. Anything that flies without a pilot is said to be pilotless. And, an aircraft is not a vehicle, it's an aircraft, full stop. This is what today's society have been taught in schools run by drug addicted teachers unlike those of my days when they were strict in grammar and spelling. But today, who gives a f***?",0

Great question! An SDK is a package of software that interfaces with API's. They are usually built to help you get started. For instance: the AWS SDK is just software that you can use to interact with the AWS API's in a easier way (without having to figure out how all the API requests work).,0

"I don't know how this problem can be solved generally, but I'll give an example. Orchid, which allows for decentralized VPN services, uses POS to select which node on the network will route a user's internet hops. Of course, a larger stake makes them more likely to be selected for a certain block. However, if the stake is so large that they are being awarded more blocks than they can possibly handle (being asked to provide more bandwidth to the network than they are able), then the extra staked amount is wasted. This gives an incentive not to stake more than what is needed. And also, it's important to note that pools DO exist very explicitly on most POS networks, as they allow you to ""delegate"" your staked coin to someone who has met the minimum amount to stake (these minimums are usually in the range of thousands of USD). I think a better permanent solution would be to introduce an artificial dis-economies of scale into the network, by having the chance of being selected for a block vary sub-linearly to the amount of stake on the network. For example, Validator_Chance = (Stake)^(.99) or something like this.",0

"Hi Simply Explained, in terms of security, I have a question that would love to hear from you, In this instance, lets compare two hardware wallets, I heard the Cobo Vault Pro private keys are derived from physically generated entropy (TRNG) which is the randomness is only determined by human decision and TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers (like atmospheric noise) however if compared with the Ellipal Titan, the Ellipal is only using PRNGs which uses mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated) which in lay man terms means another computer can actually predict the private keys with the use of computers? Also is the private keys the only factor which is affected by the TRNG or PRNG and are passphrase creation affected by TRNG or PRNG? And last question, when a hardware wallet says you can import your own private keys, does it mean you can create and invent your own private keys and if yes, how do we actually create our own private keys and is a private key used for the entire wallet or per type of coin wallet? Thanks Simply Explained!!!",0

This was because my .map file wasn't created even though I had set sourceMap: true in my tsconfig.json.

"This approach of using 3 computers as ""brain"" is derived from/based on the main computer of Soviet Space Station ""Mir"" from the early 80th, it was called ""3х-каналка"", i.e. ""3-channeled"". The idea is the same -- 3 computers in parallel run the same program and react to the same inbound data and commands. Each tick, special hardware compares states of 3 computers -- if 2 computers have the same state, but 3rd got different one -- the ""correct state"" will be selected based on majority approach.  And the 3rd machine will be either refreshed( in many cases it was simply clonning the state of CPUs and memory from ""correct"" machine), either rebooted. If 3 sequential refreshes can't fix it during some time, 3rd machine will be halted for some short period and then restarted once again. If restart can't help -- it will immediately get in touch with cosmonauts and send signal back to  Earch mission control center.  One of the most complicated parts is actually the one that compares 3 computers and does ""voting"". It has to guarantee it got snapshots of machines in sync, and it has to withstand any radiation, temperature and vibration. Also, they had system that is activated if all 3 machines got complitely different state. As far as I remember -- it was trying to rollback state of machines to the latest consistent and re-run program from that state/step. If this doesn't help -- ... there was secret protocol to be used. :)",0

Triple redundant computers plus a comparator is used in Vancouver Canada's unmanned public transit system called SkyTrain.

"Ironically those old clunky computers Nasa used for Apollo were far more Radiation immune due to their lack of nanometer scale parts and the higher wattage of said computers made the bitflips even more difficult because whatever radiation trying to cause it needs to overcome the higher voltage/amperage of the parts.

"@András Bíró  Correct.  In fact, if it weren't for the graphical user interfaces on the Dragon 2, they could do everything with Arduinos. :)  This may seem funny, but I'm not kidding.  In comparison to the LVDC in the Saturn V's Instrument Unit, the Arduino Uno has a similar amount of memory for instructions (actually a bit more), a similar amount of RAM (actually a bit more), and over 1000 times the processing speed.  The Saturn V is a fairly complicated rocket, too, with 3 stages plus a reignition of the third stage for TLI.  The Falcon 9 is simpler, except for the first stage (which would need its own Arduinos) landing, but with 1000+ times the processing speed of the LVDC, I bet the Uno could handle that task.  SpaceX's use of modern-ish dual-core Intel CPUs is lavish, even extravagent (not counting GUIs) compared to what is needed.  Computationally, on the flight hardware itself, we went to the Moon and back on far less than what an Arduino Uno can do.",0

"First, this series is awesome! I'm here because I'm having API Gateway issues, but I did want to leave anyone that sees this video in the future with a slight code update. At the time of writing, callbacks aren't used in NodeJS 12.x, they now use returns. I *think* you can still use context, but honestly I'm still confused about what context does, and I haven't seen anyone use it. So instead we'll use async to handle the event and a return to bring it back to the caller. Here's the code:  ------ 'use strict'; console.log('Loading function'); exports.handler = async (event) => {     let min = 0;     let max = 10;           let generatedNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * max) + min;          return(null, generatedNumber); };  ------  Everything else should be the same.",0
"i see they woud have 3 big problems here (among many others). 1 - how you would decentralize/randomize who would be ""judging"" who - if it's not computing power and rewards (already excellent news) how they will define it? random within what? all the users? geographic location?   2 -  how you will decide what has to get downloaded live on the ""judging"" tangles and what will be on the cloud all the time.  3 - how the algorythmn wouldn't be too heavy so that let's say, a mobile phone wouldn't be able to judge any transaction and how it wouldn't be too light so that it could be broken fast enough before new tips of the tangle come.   my best guess is that they should use random cryptography. the cryptography that the next tangle would use to confirm the two of the former should depend on an equation which would be a mix of two of the former blocks randomized by itself in a way that the own cryptography could understand and is updated constantly. so it would be really hard to fake because  1 old transactions would be old within seconds and really decentralized - so almost impossible to fake an old tangle 2 in order to fake a new tangle, you would need to get the right equivalency of both equations that would be on the next block, and in time.  anyway, i really believe this is by far the best idea out there.  i really hope they have done well on those 2 and a half years.",0

"@DK Bitcoin has become a scam itself. It was supposed to be a distributed decentralized peer-to-peer cash system if you read the whitepaper, and for a time it was, but now its development is controlled by Blockstream, mining is controlled by Chinese cartels, it's only traded on centralized exchanges and because the network can't handle more than 7 transaction per second, the cost of making a transaction is now several dollars where it used to be cents. And because the block rewards halves every 4 years, miners won't be profitable unless they keep hiking transaction costs, so in 10 years users will have to pay $15 for a transaction to maintain the same level of security  Bitcoin is no longer a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system as envisioned, it's something completely else, not what Satoshi envisioned  And frankly, anyone would be kind of stupid to think the very first iteration of a blockchain was going to be the most successful one and so well made that it could never be improved upon. Bitcoin was awesome, it changed the world and paved the way for a lot of cool things, but it was a beta version of a blockchain, it can not support a global economy or billions of users and Blockstream and their die hard followers has made it clear Bitcoin won't be improved because ""code is law"" (except of course for the one time where an exploit allowed 1 dude to mint as many Bitcoin he wanted, but we're not supposed to talk about that) So anyway, there are 1000s of shitcoins and scams out there without a doubt, but there are also some really exciting successful projects that actually see use beyond pure speculation and cultist fanboyism",0

NO more!!!! Cardano is invaluable because the dollar worth nothing its just digits in a monopoly game and that stands for all the fiat !! This current evaluation in dollars will eventually become not applicable. Holding ADA will make you very resistant to the unfortunate chain of events that has already began. The Cardano society is consisted of smart and honest people who are looking not only into the creation but the stimulus to change this financial system which has never actually been working properly, never benefited the masses but the few giving them control. It is all about control and with Cardano you and me all of us has control. My logic is pushing me into investing every bit of free fiat into Cardano and I ll be doing this even when Cardano passes 100 USD fake dollars..its never about the money its about control it matters not who has what but who controls it! remember this!!",0

Not everyone can afford or want broadband.,0
It’s kind of annoying when you say Americans regarding people who lives in the USA. People living in Latin America are also Americans.,0
"Not at all. You would never notice the satellites with the naked eye. If you use a telescope you’d pretty much have to look for them to see them. Also, you see stars mostly because of how shiny they’re. Satellites wouldn’t glow.",0
"Hack what in particular? Satellites must follow very strict guidelines for security, a bit like rockets! If you could hack satellites then you could probably hack missiles. But doing so is pretty much impossible.",0
"Great video, this explanation helped me make sense of a lot of curiosities I had about it.  I think the balance between satellite pollution verses profit-driven humanitarian goals such as expansion of internet availability for all is a delicate thing modern politics is not familiar with handling yet.  It will be interesting to see how global agreement evolves for treating our space-sky versus business ventures and what is best for humanity.  Either way, brilliant move by Elon to use reusable rockets as the driver for satellite internet market domination.",0

Thanks so much for sharing. I got to witness a rocket launch in 2018. Incredible experience. I posted a pretty awesome video of the trip to my page.,0
"Kind of amazing that this is subtitled “is internet satellite a good idea” and you didn’t mention, even once, the effective destruction of the night sky over an enormous swath of the planet. Ground-based astronomy remains one of our most important and significant endeavors as a species — certainly more important and significant than downloading games — and these satellites render it effectively impossible across the entire swarm’s orbit.",0
"The 35,000km altitude is for satellites in geostationary orbits. Most communications satellites today are in that orbit. These are used for TV broadcasts, satellite telephony and satellite internet (albeit really slow, as I mentioned). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit",0
I really wish to live on no satellite Earth and  don't use any electromagnetic waves at all like on a virgine planet that was 200 and more years ago. I hope humanity will find different way to communicate much faster and better... without harm and danger.,0
Hopefully Starlink will solve the affordability of it. I really believe that having access to broadband internet is a huge advantage for personal development.,0

"Thanks for the video, and I came here to make a similar comment. AFAIK, and our lecturer brought the secondary computer to demonstrate, the exception caused a fail-over, to rapidly reoccur also in the secondary computer, triggering the self-destruct. I was not aware of any faulty interpretation of data.",0
"You should make another video talking about if this is worth it. You mention a lot of interesting info but leave out the cons of such technology. For instance the pollution of orbit, health implications of the radiations, surveillance, military uses, hacking... need to all be considered. At the end of the day we already have internet on earth and I'm sure some people want to have a place where they can be internet free.",0
"I agree 100% that governments should jump on this and create a full-blown ""Space Debris Treaty"". Historically, it wasn't needed because satellites were expensive and there were only few.  But now, with cheaper hardware and cheaper rockets, we're launching more stuff than ever before. That will require management or we will spoil the party for everyone.",0
Fantastic !!! Great Video  and nice explanation. CU SOON.,0
"@Dat Mickey It's true they have made improvements, but they are still visible (and can be very bright depending on the angle to the sun)... but that's only part of the story; it's also about the interference they can cause to Radio and infrared research telescopes.",0
I think that I have to watch the video again...,0
@Simply Explained China did a test of its anti-satellite missile system a few years back by targeting and destroying an old satellite in orbit. That single act increased space debris by about thirty per cent since it involved shattering two very large pieces of equipment most of which stayed in orbit.,0
What about a .zip library I have already download in one directory ? How can I include it ?,0
"I did address the problem of space debris. Not sure if health implications should've been addressed in this video. That's a big debate with no definitive evidence for healthy or hazardous.  I don't get your point about surveillance. Starlink is just another way to access the internet. Do you worry about surveillance of your ISP? What about your government?  ""At the end of the day we already have internet on earth"" -> Did you watch the video? 45% of households DON'T have internet. That's billions of people! Not insignificant.",0
"​@Simply Explained Sorry I wasn't very clear. I just listed some of the potential cons Starlink may have as you seem fair in your analysis, because I think there is enough to do whole separate video just on that.   With the surveillance I'm referring to Starlink being a project actively supported by the US government, which should raise concerns as we know how they love to track everything we do through the internet. And well yes ISPs collect data on our online activities too, everything has to go through them.  What I mean is that on one hand many lack internet access, but it should also be acknowledged that there are people maybe in more remote areas of the world who do not want radiations in their air.",0

"I would add simpler explanation. We have forgotten to take into account the biggest lurking variable - population growth (generational). The number of households consuming may have increased and cause an uptick in the electricity consumption of those appliances, even if the price or other variables were held constant. Your reply is spot. However, we could add the fact that the growth rate of households would in any case increase electricity consumption even with those marginal reductions. Finally, have you ever heard of planned obsolescence? It is the deliberate process of giving technology short lifespans. Thus, with the utility diminishing faster, there would be a greater replenishment of those appliances which contributes a greater usage in electricity despite the energy efficiency of appliances.  In general, we need to look at lurking variables such as population and perceptive response. Perceptive being the tendency of people to act in ways that contradict our intuition of their actions e.g. a rumor about a bank run tends to cause the bank run, even if the bank hadn't initially had solvency issues and this becomes a feedback loop.",0

For example :  Currently mine me with a scrypt Asic about 400Mh/s Wiki says the best diff is 32678 If I do this for an hour I get one or two small wins, but I set the miner to 8192 I get 20 - 25 finds in one hour with a very small reward Al's before but much more often and all in all it makes a difference.

"@Nidhi Sahay   You (a ""node"") have a file of transactions on your computer (a ""ledger""). Two government accountants (let's call them ""miners"") have the same file on theirs (so it’s ""distributed""). When you make any transaction, your computer sends an e-mail to each accountant to inform them.  Each accountant rushes to be the first to check whether you can afford it (and be paid their salary ""Bitcoins""). The first to check and validate hits “REPLY ALL”, attaching their logic for verifying the transaction (""proof of work""). If the other accountant agrees, everyone updates their file…  This concept is enabled by ""Blockchain"" technology.",0

Peer-to-Peer is the true serverless!,0
"I dont get it, do i still have control over the OS that my service/site is hosted on? What if i want to SSH in and install some package that is required for a specific process that my service needs? I feel like with serverless im giving away a lot of control and the power to develop and customize processes for whatever i need them for, instead i can only do things that are 1) allowed by the cloud, and 2) compatible with the cloud. Or am i getting this wrong?",0
I love how you explain complex topics. Thank you very much!,0
Serverless products & services are a great way for centralization and this is a great way for ... censorship. Maybe something like IPFS (OrbitDB)?,0
"It really depends on where on the technology stack you purchase the service.   IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) will get you access to a virtual machine like AWS EC2, where you can install custom packages and give you more freedom.   FaaS (Function as a Service) like AWS Lambda is at the other end of the spectrum where you only code the function input and output and all (almost all) of the infrastructure details are abstracted away and you are completely locked in to the ""power and control"" of AWS infrastructure.",0
@Levar Mitchell agree 100%,0
@Simply Explained it's a NON ISSUE that only the politically-correct would opine over. No need to apolgise,0
I love these kinds of videos!,0
"I think it can also be misleading to think that moving an on-premise infrastructure to the cloud saves money. For example, we greatly depend on fast disk I/O (high IOPS) in what we do and if we were to provision the same storage capacity with the highest possible IOPS, it would cost an arm and a leg from the usual providers. I think it makes sense for non-niche environments.   I think the video should also address some of the security issues (pros and cons) with hosting your digital assets ""in the cloud.""",0
"So it's basically still in a server just not next to you. ""Cloud""",0
"Can smartphones & desktops be used as servers combined, there are millions of them, it's like running blockchains.",0

What a dumb marketing jargaon BY CLOUD PROVIDERS. Basically easy to increase/decrease the resources real-time from end-user perspective is called CLOUD (farm of servers). Nothing New. Moreover PEER TO PEER computing is real SERVERLESS or even called DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING.,0
"You are correct: with serverless you're giving away a lot of control. If you take compute products as an example. AWS Lambda (or others) only allow you to upload code, specify how much memory you want and that's pretty much it. Installing additional software on the system is not possible. Everything must be a part of your application. It's very limiting, but also very liberating if you can adapt.",0
"You could say that of the cloud in general. It does indeed centralize a lot of internet services. It's crazy to think that when AWS goes down, so does a large portion of websites on the internet. https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14792442/amazon-s3-outage-cause-typo-internet-server",0

"Good work. If you feel you have been a victim of internet scams like this there is a government website you can go and report this. Go to ic3gov. There you will link up to an FBI law enforcement website or visit Losangelesacfe@gmailcom, certified fraud examiners that offers a list of investigation and restitution services for free, there you will be educated on what you need to have to report the crime. Once you have the information needed you will be directed from there. it was helpful in my case, reporting the scam helps them take one step towards arresting the scammers.",0
"Nice. I like the presentation. For reasons, I have been participating on a Mastodon instance for a while now, but the whole thing has been a mystery to me. This helps lift at least a bit of the fog.",0
"I don't consider AWS to be serverless because you need to configure your instances and you have to update the software(os packages, wordpress, mysql etc) running your site. You also have control of how the scaling is performed. Platforms like Vercel and Netlify are truly serverless as you simply deploy your code and the rest is taken care of. There's no instance to configure or any initial resources you need to allocate.",0
There's already a file storage service that allows desktop owners to share their unused disk space for some small bit of compensation. Smartphones are not a good fit coz they are optimized to save battery consumption.,0
@Michael Wanyoike What is the name of the service.,0
Very well explained.   What software did you use to create the video?,0
"AWS has many regular but also many serverless products. Check out S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, CloudFront, Aurora, SQS, Kinesis, ... All of these don't allow you to fiddle with the software. They scale up & down without you intervening.",0
"You can look at it in both ways. A server is a piece of hardware (special computer, weird form factor, ...) but, like you mentioned, it's also a term for software that is capable of offering services to others on a network. A server can be both.",0
Great explanation!,0
Watching this in 2020 and its broadens my programming knowledge. Thanks!,0
@Simply Explained Agreed. Thanks for the clarification,0
Clutch video. Excellent explanation of block chain. So much simpler of a concept than when you just hear it explained.,0
"To my understanding, what you're describing in this video is mainly the concept of virtual sever. Server-less is more like AWS lambda: no server OS management, no network / firewall management, no container management, no load balancing management. I could be wrong though.",0
"That depends on how to define a server. In fact, Peer is usually considered as both server and client.",0

"The rich get richer in both scenarios.. in fact all scenarios. That includes the stock market, real estate, & everywhere else.  Except in Proof of Work the miners benefit from it more than investors or  those who ""hodl"". You can't even build apps or cloud storage/databases on a PoW blockchain because it's too difficult, time consuming & slow.  Bitcoin is limited to its monetary capabilities. Its a great store of value but that's all it will ever be.  By all means HODL some BTC.  But you can easily HODL a stablecoin & earn consistent returns through interest on DeFi apps without price volatility.  Proof of Stake, though, is more decentralized by far, works as a store of value & can have more than 1 purpose. You can build apps & databases on top of a PoS blockchain because it's fast & comprises high scalabilty. It is able to provide solutions to real world problems. There's an abundance of utility although not everything is worth having on chain nor should it be. A lot of useless coins/tokens out there; shitcoins.   Ultimately, Bitcoin's tendency to deplete the Earth's finite resources, waste time, energy & computing power is what makes it a legacy system.",0

What's to keep an illegal alien from stealing someone's ballot and casting a ballot for some candidate that promises to give him free stuff? I didn't understand the food example either.

"People are discouraged and leaving bitcoin because the wallet and exchange platform creators are looting money by making complicated transactions and charging for various clicks and people automatically loose money even before they start. It's important to at least make some platform where people can share and type about the bad actors. Their identity is another factor too.   In Fiat currency, you at least know who is charging you or looting from you, but for digital currencies the owners are hiding. They take our identity, but who knows the wallet owners identity? Need some regulations so that it can grow. Traffic rules are good for cars....  And think about the ones who do FROK and take coins and divide wealth to reduce the volatility. Are you guys losing popularity by supporting Fork ?",0

Proof of Work feels wrong- it's energy inefficient by design.  Is there a lucid argument in favour of continuing to produce and operate an increasing number of specialized devices running 24/7 in a mad, concurrent footrace for profit? This seems to be the opposite of sustainable development. I am excited about blockchain, not so much about (even more) rampant energy consumption in the name of greed (dressed as some kind of new utopian democracy).   Would love to hear some encouraging words from somebody way smarter than I am about why crypto won't just accelerate the environmental problems we've already been perpetrating upon ourselves... Proof of Stake seems like a logical alternative. Are there other ideas aside from these two currently being explored?",0

"Technically speaking, there's a flaw with this encryption. As long as Alice has Bob's public key and used his public key to encrypt her data. That means when she sent the data to Bob, he has the matching key aka private key to unlock it. So if you already have Bob's public key, his private key can be hacked/reveal using brute force making the computer guess until it finds the correct private key. No problemo.",0

Can this be done for monitoring DC current from solar pv?,0
"This is very similar to the route I went down around 2007 for my energy monitoring, ecept I used a much larger CT which wasn't split and I had to do the ballasting for the CT myself and mesure AC voltage. THey weren't as easily obtainable back then.  It worked OK ish with high resistivite loads but it was pitiful at low typical loads with a high reactive element.  I abandoned the CT route and moved to a blink timing and counting from the main meter using  a photo transistor.  Thats still the system I use in 2020.  Very accurate.  The only downside is that at low power consumtion the pulses can be a long time apart and so don't update too frequently.  The meter is a typical 1000 pulse per kWh so at 60 watts the pulses are a minute apart. . at 3.6 kW a second apart. THere is a further problem usng the ESP32 in that the analog to digital converter is a bit iffy (read non linear) at the ends of the voltage scale,",0
"In the Dropbox example, its Encryption => bcrypt => Hash => Password. Essentially, they work backwards.  First, they receive your password in plaintext which you enter into whatever login screen. Then, they hash it, and then use bcrypt on it. They will then retrieve the stored password hash from their databases, and decrypt it. At this point, the password you sent to them has been hashed, and bcrypted, and the password they stored has been decrypted, so if they are the same password, it should be equal. If they are equal, then that means you entered the correct password.",0

"Proof of Stake will lead to centralization. Only a very small number of people will have enough money to stake so this system will make the rich even richer. Also, the Proof of Stake mechanism will be complicated. This means that a very small handful of companies will offer Proof of Stake services so that other investors can participate. This means that a very small number of validator companies would control the network. We should not move to Proof of Stake. Proof of work allows the small guy, even someone with only 1 computer and 1 GPU, to participate in the network which is why it is so distributed. Proof of Stake would allow a very small number of people to control the entire network and lead to centralization.",0

"Just use the Arduino IDE.  It doesn't stop working, I've programmed, built and released two projects this year, in the same time that it's taken me to NOT get PlatformIO to even run ""hello World"".",0
"Two things,   Why? Why do I need to ""Use PlatformIO's dependency manager to automatically install and update any Arduino library you want to use."" Can't PlatformIO just tell me that an installed library needs updating, like the Arduino IDE does, and offer to install ones I ask for that aren't already there? Makes the I in ""Integrated Development Environment"" look incorrect and silly.  And why am I going to be typing in the name of a library, with all the potential that for error that introduces? Can't I just click it, like the Arduino IDE?  My memory is not what it was, I can't remember things the way I used to when I was 20. And some libraries (TFT_eSPI springs to mind) erase any custom settings that you have changed, why would I want that updating automatically?",0
"Simple projects will just recompile, more complex ones don't need much change. The biggest change is that Arduino GPIO pin identifiers have a D in them and ESP32 doesn't.  Once you choose the right board in the Arduino IDE, the linker chooses the right version of the library (with occasional warnings ""duplicate library found"" but it always chooses the right one for me.)  I just gave my ESP32 binary clock to its recipient, who is very happy with 3 different displays, Wifi time setting, time zone changing, auto dimming, network selection and password entry.  Next is a ""spaceship control panel"" for a granddaughter, I'm just programming the radar, and maybe that can switch to be a quick driving game in the same display, she can switch between them and the countdown with NASA voice and the takeoff sequencing...  I'm not a professional programmer and I've never got PlatformIO to actually work; or, at least, not to the extent of compiling and running anything more complex than ""hello World"" and today it wouldn't even do that. It's a bit obstructive, really, great for the people that love it and have time to play with it and tune it, I suppose.",0

Say that Spotify does offer an API that allows fetching data from a playlist. You can extract the data with an API key by embedding the API key to the URL provided by spotify. Once you are able to extract the obtain the URL, some other program (fron the API) will generate a JSON file for you.

question is when you transfer money to someone to develop something who is going to ensure that the product has been developed and developed in accordance with the contract? i mean i deal with contractual disputes all the time and there must be someone who will ensure that any contracts between cardano's community and third parties is enforced. imagine that you give money to someone to develop something and that someone just takes money and disappears or that someone does not deliver the product as promised.. what then?,0

2:16 i thought proof of STAKE (not work) is where one node is randomly chosen to validate the next block?,0
"Whoop-de-do. Revolutionary, huh?  This is something that is intended to impress the uninitiated.  Well, I was a programmer for many years so ... here come some references.  The hierarchical model database was introduced in the 60s by IBM. It was called IMS. Each record pointed to the next record.  Linked lists were developed 10 years earlier, in the 50s. Linked lists and binary trees were used to develop those hierarchical structures.  And now, we have blockchain, something brand new, something mysterious, something revolutionary, something everyone is gushing about. In reality, it's nothing more than another implementation of a linked list, one that connects blocks of data by hashes instead of pointers. Oh, wait, I forgot. It's distributed. I guess that's what makes it brand new and revolutionary.  This is a better mousetrap. The reason why it exists today and not 50 years ago is because then we could not pass data fast enough between the nodes. Even today, if you notice, blockchain technology is not really being developed that quickly. They've been talking about it and talking about it. They've been talking a lot and not doing much. Do you know why? 10 minute proof of work is a real killer? Stock exchanges process data in milliseconds. 10 minutes? Seriously? Also, even with today's fiberoptic networks, it takes a long time to share the massive ledger with every member of the network.  It's a good technology but it has limitations and because of those limitations, it will not be adopted in many business areas. Same as desalination technology is not going to be adopted around the world because it creates a poisonous byproduct. Same as electric cars will not just explode and replace gasoline cars all over the world. In another 5-6 years, people will be faced with the difficult task of disposing of used-up batteries and shortages of rare earth metals.",0

@John Smith The ESP2866 and ESP32 are both used in pretty high volume devices on the market. However these are pretty powerfull chips and use a decent bit of power to work so you'll want to review your requirements with that in mind.,0

They can't be trusted to serve in place of micro controllers in many applications, especially if they handle safety systems, as long as you don't rely on them for the wrong things, they are great.  Not cheap, but if you need their capabilities, it's great.  Especially the Arduino's, the ESP's a much better but still not trustable in critical applications.",0

"In PoS, even if you somehow manage to gather 51% of the total coins, as mentioned to be 79B $ worth of bitcoins as explained in the video, you are only ensuring that you get to be the validator for the next blocks. The block you build and propagate still has to be validated by all the other nodes in the network.

"My problem with getting blockchain usage though my head, is that all the uses do not require blockchain to be made.   For example, why do we have to use blockchain when listening to songs in order to have the authors paid? Why not use ""conventional"" methods, like, write all the songs someone wrote on a database, and at the end of the month, distribute them accordingly.   Why not have your car statistics sent to your insurance with each trip? Why use blockchain and hashes.  Apart from specific use cases, where you have to create a ""tamper"" proof method for something, I don't understand why we should use blockchain.  It's not like having your car mileage sent to your insurance company already exists (maybe it does). But, I think, let's create this IoT feature (sending the mileage), then you can get your insurance to adjust your contract according to your stats, and then, IF we have suspicions and testimonials of tampering, we could consider blockchain.  It's like having an RF-id / card to open a door to your house. In my mind, all these examples say ""with the technology of RF-id, we can now have houses"". Ummm, no, we can have some improvements that might solve some potential problems, but most things mentioned in this video can be created without blockchain.

Why just not use a faster crypto to transact?  It's like keep fixing something that always breaks down instead of replacing it. Bitcoin isn't practical for everyday transactions. Like gold.

Just get a newer model and be done with it.,0

"@Darren I said it depends on the project, and for production or industrial use, the set up time means nothing.  And they are under a dollar, even at single digit volumes, actualy the listing is gone :(  Now even from mouser at high volumes it's still a bit over a dollar for 28 pin dips,  but lower pin models are still under a dollar at single digit volumes so my point still stands.  Several bucks for a large bulky arduino, or 40¢ for a small dip or surface mount controller?  If you don't need the power and flexability of an arduino, it's a no brainer why they aren't the most cost efficient option for anything but low volume productions.",0

😆,0
"Notice: ISPs can still do reverse DNS lookups on IP addresses you connect to. This is *not* a replacement for Tor.   Also I'm kinda suspicious about these proxy servers. If the organization who runs the DNS resolver also runs the proxy server, they can still figure out who you are and what websites you visit.",0

"@Zyansheep you don't need to know the data to follow it. ""All the switch can see is what IP a packet came from, what IP its going to"" that is all you really need to follow the packet through then entire network. and they have access to it the entire way down the chain.",0
"@logan graham  ""they have access to it the entire way down the chain"" The idea behind ODNS is that ISPs don't have access to the proxy server, so they can't figure out what packets going in correlates to what packets coming out. Also in your original comment you said ""the ISP has access to all the data along the entire chain"" this is simply not true because the DNS request and response is encrypted solely between the device and the DNS server. Any ISP recording packets sent at any point between the device, proxy, and server would not be able to match DNS requests with specific IP addresses.",0
Would Blockchain solve this problem?,0
"Usually blockchain solutions are about connecting information, whereas I think if you want to be more private you want to be 'off the chain'",0
"I don't get why this is a problem, on a decentralized public blockchain, you own your data through your private key, this means that it is controlled by yourself! Not by a company or other third party. Therefore, a decentralized public blockchain complies with GDPR by definition. However, many people don't own their private keys, because they use an exchange, which is a third party that controls your data. Exchanges hold your personal information on their centrally controlled servers, not on blockchain, therefore exchanges are data controllers that need to comply to GDPR. Decentralized public blockchains already comply by definition.",0
AND proof of work computations.  that is extremely important.,0
"no, that is too simplistic.  you need to understand the distributed peer to peer network and the proof of work mining behind bitcoin as well.",0

"Can I ask is the ""previous hash"" means the selected hash fn applied to the previous block, or the cascaded hash of all previous blocks* (some kind of fn.)? I'm new to block chain, but this recalls on my memory the Ariadne authentication protocol that kept the whole chain of block hashes each time(some how similar to this) Although this seems the most informative way (everything is stored) a possible attack was to switch two  previous blocks, or similar actions where the rest will remain the same? Then a possible solution was to store the cascaded of all previous hashes to hide the plain hash of each block, and keep the relative order info hashed too. . I hope I explained it clearly, these papers were in 2005-2007 . *Now I learned that  the current hash includes the previous hash in the hashed block, i.e. some cascading is already done I have to check whether it is 100% enough to cover the hack or not (it seems it does, since switching two blocks will change the hole thread)",0

"This is what happens when somebody makes a video before they know what they're talking about. Unfortunately these days that seems to be about 99% of the time. You are conflating serverless with cloud computing and mixing up the benefits and the descriptions as if they were all one thing.  It's always easy to tell when someone doesn't actually know the definition of the thing they are trying to tell you about. THEY NEVER ACTUALLY DEFINE THE THING. All they ever do is talk about the features and the benefits without ever telling you what the thing is or how the thing actually works.  With cloud computing you still have to be concerned about a server. That server may not be your own physical hardware. And that server might be virtualized or inside of a container. Your cloud service provider will spin up multiple containers if you need them. But you still have to have configured those containers that are virtualized servers...  With serverless computing you can forget about even worrying about those containers. You never have to configure a server and you do not have to worry about how many of them are spun up or not. You do not design a little mini server to handle a little microservice and then put that in a container and then ask your cloud provider to spin up multiple copies of that as necessary. With serverless computing all you do is write a function. You give that function to the serverless service provider and let them worry about whether to put that on its own separate server or not. Rather than spinning up containers with their own abstracted away operating systems they simply allocate memory and CPU time to run that function and send you back the result. You never even had to think about a server or configure a server or containerize a server. That is the difference between cloud computing and serverless computing. Yes, all that is still on a server. But you never had to spend a moment of thought as to how that server was configured. You don't care, as long as your function returns the correct result.  What boggles my mind (AKA ""frustrates the hell out of me"")  is how much research I have had to do to figure out the difference because there are so many people like you who are in a hurry to jump in and say something, ANYTHING, so they can get the likes and views before anyone else, that they get it completely wrong.",0

"AHAHAHA, we already knew a lot about corona viruses? Are you daft mate? There has NEVER been a vaccine for SARS and yet people seem to believe a brand new super virus has managed to break ALL historical precedents and YEARS of work that FAILED trying to get a SARS vaccine and somehow this is normal.  The side effects of a faulty and rushed vaccine are not apparent for years if not decades after the fact and sometimes won't even be known until said individual produces offspring which becomes impaired due to the vaccine and yet here we are, people such as yourself saying ""It's safe"" when it's IMPOSSIBLE for ANYONE to tell the aftermath of an UNPRECEDENTED vaccine that somehow was completed, passed animal trials, passed humans trials and now has begun mass injections within mere MONTHS.  I'd suggest stepping away from medical topics and sticking to tech, you obviously are completely out of your league when it comes to understanding matters such as this and no way in hell should you be in the position of educating others when you yourself are completely oblivious to history.",0
mRNA is fragile but when the copies become part of us? Then sh!t happens. We are the virus!,0
Vaccines are only made for one reason. And that reason is not for your health.,0
https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download  Page 43-44,0
"I did not say we knew alot about vaccines for viruses. Just that we knew a lot about the family of viruses. Eg: how the spike is made, how they work and where they are encoded in the virus RNA.   Sources:  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-00468-6 https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2090  As for the safety aspect:  Yes, 10 months is not a lot, if you compare it to traditional vaccines. However, the vaccines made by different companies have been tested with large groups and have seen very little side-effects ( headache, fatigue). This makes me confident that the vaccine will save many lives.   ""you obviously are completely out of your league"" -> Perhaps. But I believe that my simplified explanation of mRNA vaccines is correct. But I respect your opinion.   As for stepping away from the topic: let me choose how to use my time and the videos I make. If this video turns out to be competely misinformed, I will take it down. But I don't believe that to be the case right now.",0
Yes they work until a new wild virus comes along then your fuked. .,0
"Sadly, yes.. But at least there's hope with this new technology 💪",0
"3:21 Hold there, if the B-cells carry the memory of the vaccine, why not just inject existing B-cells into a person's body? Or does the body not know how to replicate foreign B-cells?",0
"What a great idea! Now, go to uni, make a research team and develop a way to mass produce B-cells. Easy-peasy.",0
"@Simply Explained An animal study showed ferrets with mRNa showed great antibody response but sadly after getting infected  to a wild virus they all died because it worked to well, their own immune system over reacted. So this vaccine the elite are pushing us great until you get a cold then your fuked",0
"1) how does the initial ""virus"" INJECT  its mRNA...?  it is still not / never actually alive at this/any  stage...?   2)  how does the foreign substance/virus mRNA tell the healthy cell to reproduce it and not  your own body cell  mDNA..?  3) after vax if your own body produces those ""spike Proteins"" why would your own immune system attack them..?",0
"@Simply Explained ""I did not say we knew alot about vaccines for viruses. Just that we knew a lot about the family of viruses. Eg: how the spike is made, how they work and where they are encoded in the virus RNA.""  You mentioned it as a counter-point of somehow being representative of the speed of the vaccine in which is completely false because there has never been a corona virus vaccine before, let alone for a super strain that managed to bring the entire world to it's knees. So the entire comment about the knowledge of corona virus is completely irrelevant to both safety and vaccines because said knowledge has done nothing to bring about a vaccine.  ""Yes, 10 months is not a lot, if you compare it to traditional vaccines. However, the vaccines made by different companies have been tested with large groups and have seen very little side-effects ( headache, fatigue). This makes me confident that the vaccine will save many lives.""  Once again, immediate symptoms are merely one concern and if anything a vaccine that immediately shows adverse affects is MUCH safer than a vaccine that causes issues years down the line. If a vaccine gave adverse effects right away it would be pulled and worked on longer and not mass injected globally, however if problems are shown down the line after an unprecedented amount of people have had the vaccinations there is nothing you can do since people have already been injected with it.  ""Perhaps. But I believe that my simplified explanation of mRNA vaccines is correct. But I respect your opinion."" Your explanation of mRNA is fine, had no complaints there. However proclaiming ""safety"" in regards to an unprecedented 10 month vaccine, a vaccine in which is the first of it's kind, a vaccine that clearly has ""speed"" in mind due to the severity of the world right now, thus long-term ""safety"" is on the back-burner and you have this vaccine being distributed to every speck of the world and given to people who don't even have association with the virus yet. A global roll out such as this is also historically unprecedented and wasn't done for swine flu, bird flu, SARS, ebola and many more because those were minor viruses, yet here we are, first time doing a global roll out of a vaccine in a very long time and with a vaccine that was rushed and has completely unknown long-term effects.  ""As for stepping away from the topic: let me choose how to use my time and the videos I make. If this video turns out to be competely misinformed, I will take it down. But I don't believe that to be the case right now.""  The mRNA part was fine. However long-term effects and thus ""safety"" of a vaccine not being known until much later on is not some subjective opinion, it's 100% fact. NO ONE can say ANY vaccine will not have some sort of long-term adverse effects precisely due to the complexity of our individual bodies and some people can have something dormant in them for decades only for it to interact with something adversely and lead to all manner of issues, this even applies to very minor drugs and something as simple as a treatment for a UTI can cause fatal insomnia if it happens to interact a certain way.  And of course instances of that are the anomaly, but guess what? When you have a vaccine that's the first of it's kind for ANY corona virus, a vaccine that has been made with unimaginable speed and has been globally distributed in a fashion that has never been done before THAT is the anomaly and NO ONE can know how this unknown vaccine will affect people in the future.  So in relation to you making content as an educator you need to have that type of understanding, of course it's a good thing it's out but the fact is NO ONE can tell you if it's safe or not, you need to let people know the complexity of the situation and not throw out naive ""oh it's safe!"" when in reality the creation, distribution and future repercussions of something like this is historically unheard of. You not only need a good understanding of biology but also a good understanding of the history of these type of things and also the current political, economic and geopolitical situation playing out right now and the psychology of the people who are trying to get this vaccines out.  Once again, the goal with this vaccine is speed, to get the world back to normal and avoid the absolutely crushing economical disaster that has come to pass. The idea of ""safety"" is a secondary objective, if it works it works, long term can be solved when it happens, that is their mindset and they are taking a VERY big risk with it. It's a hard call and your job as someone who puts themselves in a position to educate others should understand that complexity and explain this to people, not give some throwaway ""it's safe"" despite that being inherently false.",0
"I did some quick Googling, and it appears to be possible to transfer T-cells from one person to another (T-cells are the part of the immune system that actually destroy a virus that has been tagged with antibodies). However, it's rarely used in humans because of possible complications.

(Source 2)  Some sources:  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)#Transfer_of_activated_T-cells - https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/4/19/4864/464130/Successful-transfer-of-anti-SARS-CoV-2-immunity",0
"""Since a few years, we have the ability to create MRNA- Vaccines, which can be developed much faster."" Such a dumb sentence. In the past, M-RNA was never approved in the first place. All vaccines can be developed fast. But they have to undergo a 5 year long testing phase in order to make sure that the ""cure"" does not more harm than the problem itself. The question is, what side effects they have on human beings. This video is completely biased. Feel ashamed for trying to fool the humanity.",0
"Okay, good point about the long-term safety. I will edit the safety parts out of the video and add a clarification to the description. Thanks!",0
I was pointing to the fact that mRNA vaccines are relatively new as a technology. Sorry you feel that this video is biased. I tried to objectively describe the technology (parts about the safety are being removed),0
"First of all, someone corrects me if I'm wrong. 1) the virus itself has its own DNA or RNA, it depends on the type of virus. hypothetically speaking, let's assume we have two types of human, a human that has DNA and another human that has RNA. both do the same thing in most cases. but I don't know the depth analogy about them. 2) all the cells inside your body have their own DNA. (Remember, we are human we have DNA in our cells.) the DNA is responsible for curing the cell itself and sending messages to other DNA cells. When a virus goes inside your body, it will find the most suitable cell to attack and own the cell easily. the virus sends a copy of instructions of their own gene to the cell and forces the cell to reproduce the same gene that the virus sent it to.  Regarding your question about your own body mDNA. it's not possible because you don't have mDNA :) you only have mRNA, tRNA, rRNA. the DNA only has one type in general. which is just DNA.(you can research more about DNA they are complicated.) Also, your body doesn't have one single DNA, and the virus controls that. it's not like that. your cells get affected when you get sick not the genes or chromosomes when a virus or bacteria entered your body. 3) your immune system will attack ANYTHING except your own MUSCLES AND CELLS AND ORGANS. other than those it will attack everything. A vaccine has the real virus itself. but the genes are modified and the virus got weaker. the virus can not invade any of your cells because it does not have any power because of the modified genes. Well, you might ask what is the point of that? The human immune system has a memory dedicated to all the attacks that have been done on foreign items that go inside your body. your immune system is responsible to kill any foreign bacteria/virus that enters your body. when they kill the virus/bacteria successfully. all the instruction that how they killed the bacteria/virus goes to your memory immune system which is called B-cells. who transfers those data? T-cells(research if you want to know more about them). that way, if the weaker virus goes to your body and doesn't have any power to dominate your cells, after that, the virus gets killed easily and your memory cell got the instruction to kill the virus next time if it enters your body. that's the main point of vaccination.",0
"No. Thats not how it works. This video does simplify the process a lot, in reality there is not really a possibility of ""turning us into the virus""",0

"The biggest issues were the stability of the mRNA. It's very fragile and gets destroyed by our body before it can do its thing.

This is the nth time I'm asking this but here goes - what does 95% efficacy really mean?  Did they expose the trial participants to the original virus after getting the vaccine to prove it's effectivity?,0
"Hi! Interesting question. No, they did not infect people with COVID19 after they received the vaccine. In Phase 3 testing, a large group of people from all ages is chosen and split in half. One half receives the vaccine, the other half a placebo. You can then determine the efficacy of the vaccine by looking at how many people actually got COVID19 after their shots.  To quote TheConversation: ""If fewer people who received the vaccine become sick compared to those who received placebo, we have direct evidence that the vaccine prevents disease."" Source: https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-clinical-trials-test-covid-19-vaccines-146061  Here's a paper from Pfizer/BioNTech about their testing methodology: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577  Same thing: ""Among 36,523 participants who had no evidence of existing or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose were observed among vaccine recipients and 162 among placebo recipients. This case split corresponds to 95.0% vaccine efficacy""  This particular paper even has a nice graph (figure 3), showing the onset of COVID19 infections in both groups.  I'm sure other companies like Moderna, have similar studies with similar methodologies.",0

"I think I have a pretty good idea of how a block is added on the Bitcoin blockchain, but I find the above reference to proof of work confusing relative to my understanding.  Why is it referred to as a consensus algorithm?  What does that even mean?  My concept of Proof of work is that it is just a competition between miners designed to try as many random numbers as they can, plugging them and all the transactions that they pulled from the web that they wish to add into a block on the chain, mash it all up, and get a number that is less in value than the hashed result of the previous block.  When they win the race, they earn bitcoin and add the new ledger of transactions as a block on the chain of which the ledger also includes the bitcoin that they earned.  So, again, it is basically a race or a competition.  Where does this word consensus come from?  How does being the first to solve a problem of random transactions, pulled from the web, verify among the network of computers that the information added to the chain is valid?  How does racing to do a mathematical equation prevent double spending of bitcoin or of spending bitcoin that someone does not have?  No one has ever been able to clearly answer this question for me, so if you can, I sincerely thank you in advance.",0

Most of the time synthetic mRNA contains additional elements used for in vitro manipulation,0
"This is the beautiful side of the story. What is not know for now is whether the mRNA in the vaccine can be changed (reverse transcribed) into DNA and be integrated in the genome. This has been observed with C19 RNA (MIT study), which is one of the reasons for long-term covid. But, even if the vaccine RNA is integrated in chromosomes, it may have no effect. Another issue I noted with the mRNA vaccines is the use of saline as placebo. It would have been much better to compare to scrambled RNA lipid nanoparticles to assess adverse events of this new technology...",0

so your own body's cells produce something that is attacked by your own immune system... at what point does the immune system attack the cells themselves? how sure are you that the RNA within the cell is destroyed? What if eventually the body attacks itself because you messed with its DNA. Mad science.,0
It was unstable. The body killed of the vaccine before it could do its job. Also: it’s called progress.,0

@Slomak How is DNA not involved when it is forced to create RN,0
"@wPcky The mRNA that is in the vaccine is produced in a lab. They've taken the code from the virus spikes outside the cell, so your DNA is not involved. Normally your DNA does create it's own mRNA in the Nucleus, that then goes into the main part of the cell (Cytoplasm). The mRNA is like a car delivering the pizza. In this case Domino's is delivering to you. The point is to have those spiked proteins reproduced by your own cells, sent on their way and then your body builds a defense (antibodies) against them. Since it's only the outside spikes of the C-virus, you don't get sick, but your body now has a way to fight the real Covid virus if you get infected.",0
I rarely find people explain complex things easily .. thanks man 👍🏻👍🏻,0
@Slomak How about you go first lab rat! I'll take my chances with the 99.98% survival rate cough rather than experiment on my own bodies ability to fix itself. Your cells can produce the spike protein autonomously lol I'll trust the way it has always worked.,0
"Again no one references the fact your cells are now producing a protein that is slated for destruction and I haven't heard how that directive (RNA) is removed, you heard of cytokine storms well every cell in your body producing a foreign enemy protein sounds like a recipe for that.",0
"Okay, so why are people getting Covid symptoms from the vaccine if it is just producing spikes, why are people getting partial paralysis and even dying? This is official information, you probably will feel symptoms after getting the vaccine, they say it is normal and that we should not be surprised if some people die of it. In Norway 13 people have died in nursing homes now shortly after taking the vaccines. If someone tried to force me to take this I'd literally fight for my life. I have a bachelors degree in biotechnology and I would never consider taking such a vaccine, they can put anything they want into that code. You avoided telling us how this mRNA enters the cell too. It must enter with the help of a virus shell like the original Covid virus, and you basically have no control over how many spikes the cells produce either, this could cause autoimmune problems.",0
"So the treasury will be sort of like a tax system, but tax payer actually can decide on where the money goes",0
"If I can ask some question please. What if the cell’s don’t copy the the blueprint exactly, producing something else? Will our immune system get confused and start destroying all sorts of cells in our bodies? Also is the spike protein entering our bodies through the vaccines, the actual spike protein itself? Or a genetically modified spike protein?  Sorry about all the questions. Thanks.",0
I might just delete my twitter,0
"Question, how come they say that the antibodies you get from being infected by the virus wears off after just a couple of months?  So does the antibodies that the vaccine produce also wear off? We'll need to get revaccinated for covid19 every few months??",0
Don't take the vaccine you have what they call the immune system,0
That's exactly what I thought too! It's simple,0
Use this to vote and counting the vote will be nearly instant.,0
"If people aren't able to get sick from mRNA vaccines, then why is the Pfizer mRNA vaccine killing so many people? What else is in it?",0
"That's 100% false.  All we're seeing with covid mutations is an increase in infectivity. They aren't seeing any change to the spike protein, which is what gives you the immunity in the first place. Stop spreading false information.  Also, the flu shot isn't useless. It's not as effective as most other vaccines, but it's hardly useless. Even a 60% effectiveness is better than none at all",0
Nope. Literally just has to come near the Bcell.  B cell attacks it on sight.,0
"""What if the cell’s don’t copy the the blueprint exactly"" That doesn't happen?   ""Also is the spike protein entering our bodies through the vaccines, the actual spike protein itself?"" No.... the vaccine sends mRNA into your body. That tells your body to make the spike protein. Then your immune system attacks and destroys both the spike and the mRNA.",0
"It's not, end of story. Next question.",0
And we care about nature because...? And it's a vaccine. It's not changing your DNA at all.,0
Citation that they are.,0
You're an idiot.,0
"@Robert Falk Not arguing that. I am talking about equilibrium, balance. Too quick = not in balance, hence problems. They genetically modified the virus.",0
"""I'll take my chances with the 99.98% survival rate ""  Considering the mortality rate is around 2%, your numbers are off  "" I haven't heard how that directive (RNA) is removed"" It breaks down in your body fairly quickly, as RNA is quite fragile.",0
and then came Solana and fixed the scalability problem thus being the fastest blockchain in the world thats scales with hardware - gamechanger!,0
"No, they didn't genetically modify the virus. They took the sequence responsible for making the spike protein and put it in the vaccine. That doesn't change the virus, as the virus isn't being used in the vaccine.  And it's not too fast either. Most time spent making vaccines is due to funding and bureaucratic shit.  So, you're wrong. And you can stop trying to sound smart and/or woke.",0
"Well, both Chris and Kim are paranoid morons who don't have a damn clue what they are talking about.  First off, Kim, the spike doesn't stay in your cells. The spikes don't even go in your cells.  And Chris? Get a grip.",0

"Cite your sources then. And the inserts don't list side effects. They list everything reported during trials, regardless of whether or not the vaccine was the cause.",0
@Robert Falk I was talking about genetic inserts (RNA code). You do know what that is? My sources are my biochemistry textbooks and what MSM media is reporting about side effects.,0
"people are dying because of allergic reactions to certain components in the vaccine, for example, if I'm allergic to peanuts and I eat peanuts I may die because of the allergy.

"@Robert Falk it’s not my rate, I’m telling you what’s there on the governments own website. They are full of shit, that much is true.",0
"The vaccine acts like a virus attack! It hijacks your cell and forces it to make spike proteins (instead of the full virus). Then, it’s up to your immune system to say “Wft! Oh hell nah! Send in the troops!! (antibodies), We’re under attack from an invading mRNA!!” to then fight off the vaccine & create memory B cells that should then keep you protected for at least 5 months.    It’s basically the same thing your body would do anyway when it comes into contact with the actual full blow live virus. Both the mRNA vaccine & the actual Covid virus hijacks your cell & tells it to replicate themselves inside it!    This is also why the vaccine DOESN’T stop you from catching or spreading Covid! It just *reduces* your symptoms, which makes you less likely to die if you’re in that 1% vulnerable group who’s own overactive immune system is likely to kill you off (it’s *not* the actual virus that kills you!) through a Cytokine Storm, or Blood clots (google: “Platelets Innate Immune Response”), etc!    Also yes, the spike proteins that the invading mRNA forces your body to replicate does/can look similar to spike proteins on some of our bodies own actual cells (google: “lock & key model”) and this can confuse the body, causing it to attack our own good, healthy cells causing an autoimmune response.",0

"Totally agree with you!! This vaccine acts like a virus attack! It hijacks your cell and forces it to make spike proteins (instead of the full virus). Then, up to your immune system to say “Wft! Oh hell nah! Send in the *troops!!* (antibodies), we’re under attack from an invading mRNA!!” & to then fight off the vaccine & create memory B cells that should then keep you protected for at least 5 months.    It’s basically the same thing your body would do anyway when it comes into contact with the actual full blow live virus. Both the mRNA vaccine & the actual Covid virus hijacks your cell & tells it to replicate themselves inside it!    This is also why the vaccine DOESN’T stop you from catching or spreading Covid! It just *reduces* your symptoms, which makes you less likely to die if you’re in that *1%* vulnerable group who’s own overactive immune system is likely to kill you off (it’s *not* the actual virus that kills you!) through a Cytokine Storm, or Blood clots (can google: “Platelets Innate Immune Response”), etc!    Also yes, the spike proteins that the invading mRNA forces your body to replicate does/can look very similar to spike proteins on some of our bodies own actual cells (can google: “lock & key model”) and this can confuse the body, causing it to attack our own good, healthy cells causing an autoimmune response.",0

Woah since when does Javascript have native Classes?,0
excuse my question but:  how can it produce only the spikes without producing the virus itself? (to which these are normally attached)?   to me sounds like having some fruits but without having the tree that produces it.  Apreciate if you can clarify. Thanks!,0
What are downsides?,0
"Wasn't rushed. They made it fast because they didn't have to deal with funding and shit.  There won't be long term effects from mRNA, as rna is very fragile and expelled from the body quickly.  And it's because of dipshits like you that would claim anything as a ""side effect"" regardless of causation.",0
"""how can it produce only the spikes without producing the virus itself?"" Because the spike is a protein found on the outside of the virus. They isolated the RNA sequence responsible for making the spike in the virus, took it out and put just that in the vaccine, which will tell your cells to make just that part, the spike.  ""to me sounds like having some fruits but without having the tree that produces it. "" Kinda? For this analogy, imagine they took the instructions from an apple seed that made the apple, but not the rest of the tree, and put that in the ground. All that would grow would be an apple. It's not a great analogy, but it's close.",0
"I like your explanation. However, it must be cautioned that this technology does not have a track record. What will happen when this synthetic rna is produced in other parts of the body? In the case of covid, what about the lipid enclosed nano particles? They are basically tricking the cells into making a synthetic compound. What is being used to create this synthetic compound? What happens to the synthetic compound that was used to create this protein? Can the nano particles be remotely manipulated? How is it possible for the vaccine to enter the cells?",0
"Thanks for the introduction to ESP32. You mentioned Voice Recognition, could you explain further on this topic?",0

"the vaccine is unique:  it contains the cells of murdered babies.  The mrna attempts to poison dna which are the building blocks of life created by the LORD.  Satan said to Eve 'you can be like god.'  Ask yourself this question:  am I ready to die?  then make your decision.  We all have a free will and therefore have no excuse.  The LORD will destroy all those who engage in the vaccine from the pit of hell.  You do not have to be a part of this.  John 3.3,  33-34.  You will remember what I have said today.",0

"So ... I would take out the temperature animation, because bacteria give you high fevers whereas virus's give a lower grade fever.

Wouldn't that create more issues since with each fork you essentially get a copy of your coins,0
"Why is everyone assuming that the mRNA stay perfect before they are administered ?  there are studies about the implications of damaged mRNA and how the cells respond to them. mRNA is very unstable and that's why they need to be contained in nanolipids and stored at low temps.  How many % of the mRNA remain perfect after transportation and storage? What sort of proteins do our cells produce when decoding damaged mRNA? Could toxic proteins be produced and cause immediate reactions or long term issues such as cancer? how would the body cope with unintended proteins produced as a result of damaged mRNA?  IMO, there are many unanswered questions, and much research still to be done before we can tick this off as safe.",0

"In other words, you are saying that a healthy human cell is used as an incubator for the COVID 19 spikes inside a heathy human body? This is highly risky and dangerous and many things could go terribly wrong. To begin with, cells replicate themselves. So there is a chance that the cell with the COVID 19 spikes starts replicating itself becoming like a cancer cell. If the COVID 19 Spikes are produced in large quantities before the anti bodies are created, there is a chance that so many cells would be infected by the spikes, that the immune system would be overwhelmed. Besides, one should understand that the body's immune system would never attack the body's own cells, even if they are infected with a cancer virus or spikes of CIVID 19.Therefore, these mRNA drugs similar to the DNA drugs are a ticking time bomb inside our body ready to explode at any moment! A safer way would be to use an animal cell to use as an incubator for COVID 19 spikes, or like the NOVA VAC company did, moth larvae. Once the spikes are produced in large quantities, they are then packaged in the usual serum format to be injected, with the human immune system doing its job naturally, without sacrificing any healthy cells and risking COVID 19 Spike infected cells from becoming a cancer.",0

"This is something that is actively researched. Both Pfizer and Moderna tested their vaccines against the UK and South-African mutations of the virus. So far, the efficacy seems to be unchanged, which is good news.  You're correct that if the spikes would change completely, the vaccines would no longer be effective. But in that case, we're dealing with a different virus altogether.

Or would you accept the ""traditional"" vaccines?",0
"@Simply Explained he said there is pressure on many scientists to not say the truth. Why? He said, he does not know. But I think, it is because of the Great Reset program that was decided by the WEF before Covid was released (may explain why so many governments behave so strangely with a virus that is not more deadly than the flu). Anyway, in traditional vaccines, I am not against those that don't contain aluminum.  I stopped taking the flu shot since I discovered that vitamins do the job better 3 years ago (I will thank the doctor that ran the vitamin tests 3 years ago on me forever!

This vaccines are basically give you an infection with genetically engineered adenovirus (usually in nature this virus is responsible for the common cold), that unable to replicate because of deletion of many important genes in it, they just use this virus to deliver genetic information to the cells of your body, so they can produce some sars-cov-2 spike proteins and trigger the immune system.

"Sounds good in theory, maybe. You stated that you cannot get sick from it. Yet I have seen people get very sick and even die from it. The truth is that our bodies were not designed to be ""tricked"" into doing such things. They are not designed to be exposed to annual ""Flu"" vaccines either. You can develop severe auto-immune diseases that are unexpected and unwelcome results. No scientist can possibly know all of the ramifications of this experiment. If they say that they do, they are lying. The potential to ""backfire"" is immediately apparent and is also now apparently proven. The best way is the natural way that our amazing bodies are designed with. I know a lot of people who have tested positive and have made it through with ""normal"" sickness symptoms to nearly no symptoms. Why would you in light of that knowledge (other than fear) choose the experimental approach that is already fitting the description ""the cure is worse than the disease""? Everyone has free will to choose whether to take one of these new vaccines. I just hope that knowledge from research and not fear of the virus is the basis for their decision.

I owed him big time and that's a super cardinal good deed he's done.  But I still like Donald Trump. Sadly I still think Joe Biden had beaten Donald Trump because Donald Trump wants to give us more freedom from limits of high taxes he's also super good of his deed too.  Not only that he even wants to not approve the early coronavirus vaccines so we could be more safe from accidental infection from the coronavirus vaccines.  Normally it takes about 10 years to approve a vaccine against the virus.  What I think of this eather way.  We're all doomed from it eather way.  😭,0

How ingenious,0
"They are not getting sick from it, they are having an immune reaction, it is well understood that you may feel a little off for a day or so while your body is creating antibodies. But this goes away. The deaths have not been linked to the vaccine. When you're vaccinating millions upon millions, many of these people 75+, you're going to see stories of people dying afterwards. However, it's likely they would have passed regardless from other various causes. The fact of the matter is vaccines are necessary for a healthy society and while the covid mRNA vaccine is the first to be used, it has been around for years and the technology is not new at all. It is shown that COVID itself can cause lasting, long term, debilitating effects if you are one of the unlucky ones. So while it's a scary decision to make, i'd take my chances with the DNA of covid rather then the full on virus.",0

"b cells are another name for white blood cells! also known as plasma cells.  Our body naturally makes these in our bone marrow, our b cells (white blood cells) travel in our blood.  B cells are the cells that produce/manufacture antibodies! When we have had an infection, B cells will produce antibodies to fight that infection (along with triggering of other immune responses like getting a fever when you're sick). Antibodies will then stick around in your body for a little bit before naturally decreasing in quantity, however memory B cells (white blood cells that 'remember' the infection you got) will stay for longer and if they run across that virus or bacteria again they will make more antibodies to fight it.  Regarding Covid specifically a couple studies were done that show people who got COVID had antibody levels decrease after about 20 days post infection, while memory B cells that remember the COVID virus stuck around for 8 months after infection. Vaccines are generally more effective that natural immune response without us needing to get sick in the first place, this is also great because if we get immunity while not being sick, we can't pass the virus on and the spread of COVID will decrease, so you'll be even less likely to get it in the first place!  link to article about the two studies: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/two-studies-find-covid-19-antibodies-last-8-months  Hope that helped! let me know if you have any questions",0

It showed an increase in temperature as a symptom of the disease.  No.  Completely wrong.  Fevers are an immune response created on purpose by our bodies to kill off the virus or infection.  Viruses and bacteria do not, on their own, increase our temperature.",0
"True facts about this vaccine:  (1)  Never before has an mRNA vaccine been approved for use on human beings (CDC website states this).  (2)  The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has only been tested on 30,000 people (79% of them were white) (NIH website states this).  (3)  The vaccine only underwent clinical trials for 4 months (the NIH website states this), therefore no long-term studies have ever been done on humans for mRNA vaccines, let alone this vaccine in particular.  What long term effects could there be?  No one knows.  This technology is literally causing your body to have an immune response to the proteins it's own self is producing - what could go wrong?  What if some of the mRNA hangs around and doesn't get properly destroyed by your body?  What if your cells are hypersensitive to the protein or become hypersensitive, such that any exposure to the virus causes a WORSE reaction than would have been had you never had the vaccine?   Literally no one has the answers to these questions.  And they want to give us a vaccine - some 7+ billion people, when it's only been tested on 30,000 people, 79% of which were white?  This is laughably ridiculous and unscientific, but if you follow the money, you'd see why.",0

"@SALINAS First of all, this is ONLY approved for Emergency use authorization.  So technically it is still experimental.  They do not know how long the 2 shots last.  Could be 2 months for some people, 8 months for others.  Guessing game as to when they are going to give you a booster.  Check out the CDC VAERS report for the thousands of adverse effects happening to the public that the Main Scream Media is not telling you.  That is supposedly only 1% reporting  but even if it is 25% reporting it is extremely worrisome.  People who question Big Pharma are called anti vaxxers.  Well after all the lawsuits over FDA approved drugs that have killed and maimed people over the years, I think the people who question this are in their rights and you should be questioning it also.",0
very good video thanks,0
@Robert Falk Yeah so how long does it last before a booster needed?  Why only emergency use approval ? You know that nothing will happen in a few years because of what data?

""Have you even looked at the CDCs own website of the VAERS report"" First off, the CDC and VAERS are completely different organizations; one has nothing to do with the other. Secondly, literally anyone at any time can make a VAERS report without any evidence whatsoever.  VAERS is not an indication that a vaccine is dangerous; hell, a layperson such as yourself shouldn't even look at it, because you aren't trained to interpret the reports and weed out the bullshit.

"If this vaccine was 90% effective at stopping you from dying/ hospitalisation/ getting Co vid then you would prove it by having two groups of say ( 10,000?). In the group that didn’t get the vaccine pretty much if all of them died/ went to hospital / got co vid ( depending on what you tested for) and 90% ( 9,000) of those vaccinated didn’t  die/ got to hospital / or get co vid then THAT would be 90% effective at preventing  death / hospitalisation/ infection. That’s how stark it would need to be to truly make a 90% effective claim. That’s the kind of result you would need to show a new cancer drug was “ 90% effective “ at keeping you alive.  So think on this claim of “ 90% effective”. What does it really mean? Not much really. Effective at what exactly? Out of a study of 30-40,000 only around 200 or so even got any problems. The placebo injection group had 99% success at not getting co vid simply from not having the vaccine. The “ 90% effective” claim is an advertising hype. It’s a bumper sticker slogan designed to dupe those who don’t think clearly. It’s wishful thinking. A piece of mathematical sophistry. They will make billions from it that’s for sure......",0

"The issues here are that mRNA vaccines genetically modify human-DNA.  And when such vaccines start attacking what our DNA produce naturally, it will more likely lead to auto-immune disease. And even worse when human-DNA is GMO’d, we humans, become property of BigPharma and it can be easy to be controlled remotely.  These m-RNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer also include sterilizing agents and subsets of HIV as recently, it showed some of the people who took them, also got infected with HIV.   At this time, a safe vaccine against Covid-19 not based on m-RNA schemes is Sputnik-V from Russia and Sinopharm from China. To this days, m-RNA vaccines are still even experimental according to FDA, which means anyone who takes them, are like Guinea Pig.",0

See what Dra Carrie Madej (and others) has to say about it. Plus, you didn't mention that the biggest dick, I mean, donor behind this fraudulent vaccine agenda is Bill - Epstein's friend - Gates. Yes, the sicko who wants to vaccinate everyone on this planet.  Before someone points the finger to me calling me a ""anti-vaxx"", I'd like to tell you that I have my (and my chidlren) vaccines up to date (those which make sense, where well tested, developed, secure and indeed prevent us from something bad).

"Is the mRNA patented? Is the RNA and resulting protein been reviewed by a third party? What excact genes are reproduced by the mRNA? Sars-Cov-2 can transmit between humans because it contain human genes, will the mRNA reproduce this part of the virus? In that case autoantibodies may be produced. Pfizer have been sued for billions for fraud over the years, and now we should trust them to rush a vaccine that will go straight into the cells of the whole population on earth? Hell no! Is it REALLY that easy to develop mRNA, in a month, as they say? It seems very rushed, no matter how much money you throw at it. They also skipped a lot of safety tests, actually everybody that takes it is a test-subject. This first-to-marked vaccine will make endless money, that's the sole goal.",0

"I have a question for the community, and I am sure this is something that has been thought about. I have a basic understanding of microbiology from undergrad, but many things are still fuzzy and unknown to me.. So, is the corona virus ligand unique? Could it be that many other endemic cells of the human organism have the similar enough ligands that they could be targeted by the immune system...Thought, I guess if that were the case, the body could probably differentiate.... Also, I'm curious, and maybe somebody know...In this video, the idea is that there is just one specific ligand coded in the mRNA. Is it actually a bigger chunk of the exterior virus coat? Would more ligands increase specificity, or confuse the immune system more? hmmmm?",0

Extremely superficial explanation. Devil hides in details. This type of vaccines has never been used before on humans and many animals when this  technology was used died. The protein spike coding can be inaccurate and create irreversible for human body damage invading the human cell and transmitting the information about this spike. What about auto immune respond? Why you don't mention the serious details regarding to mrna technology? People have a perfect intellectual capacity to learn the details of the process and have the rights to be aware of consequences if the technology goes wrong. What about the  possibility of reverse  RNA-DNA transcription process  in the cell in a long term perspective ? Who will be responsible for this? Who will pay for this potentially irreversible damage to the human genome?,0
"My question is similar to Drak Drakov's: Does the spike protein manifest as a structure on the human cell, and if so, is there a risk of autoimmune reactions where antibodies attack the human cells which have this protein structure? Or, does the protein structure ""break off"" of the cell surface, circulate, and by that means cause an immune response that does not involve the cells themselves?",0
"Good questions, Drak. As to #5, I believe the spike protein is the ""mirror image"" of the ACE-2 protein on the cell surface, so an antibody that can attach to the spike wouldn't attach to the ACE-2. But I do have a concern if the spike manifests on the cell membrane as in your question #3. That seems like it would result in antibodies attaching to healthy cells. As to question #1, half lives of naturally occurring mRNA molecules seem to be measured in minutes to hours. I don't know what it is for this vaccine, but it's an excellent question! I would guess that it's not on the order of days, though, once the lipid coating is shed.",0

"Yes, you're right. Your natural immunity should prevent you from getting sick again. But at this stage it's unclear how long natural immunity lasts (the same holds true for COVID19 vaccines).

Absolutely spot on. Moderna vaccine is very very effective and no side effects.,0
"@Tony Roy, thanks.  In short, basically yes.  However, if you’re one of the *rare few* who have a history of anaphylaxis or you have to carry an epipen, then probably best not to get the vaccine.  Otherwise, yes, *please do* get the vaccine;  you’re very unlikely to see worse side effects than soreness at the injection site, and maybe slight fatigue.  Even those who do have a history of anaphylactic shock are statistically on the order of 1 in 11 million (see reference below) to react to the vaccine.  Definitely check with your doctor, and get vaccinated at a facility that can treat you in the unlikely event you do get a reaction.  I gather that there’s been some uncertainty with regard to pregnancy.  Although the vaccine trials excluded pregnant women from the start, some trial participants became pregnant during the course of the trial, and neither the fetus/child nor the mother suffered any ill effects.  So I gather that most doctors see no reason not to get the vaccine if you’re pregnant.  Probably not a bad idea to ask your doctor first though.  https://youtu.be/KVLndvFlvEI",0

@Nope I was recently looking into IPFS (Interplanetary File System) as a possible viable alternative – and it’s clear this one falls in the peer-to-peer category with nodes. While being decentralized and difficult to enforce any censorship it seems to have the usual security risks as peers can be tracked and identified on the ‘network’ no matter how large and widespread it is. Unstoppable Domains is also an interesting candidate (in the decentralized category) but this one is not free and can only be accessed with special plug-ins and resembles TOR in many ways (hard to access and needing proprietary software components). The best solution may be peer-to-peer infinite modules (for the content creation side) gathered on the fly impossible to trace or stop and some  blockchain cloud server (for storage of data) that would be free to use with no IP tracing. As for these other so-called ‘uncensorable’ ‘unmoderated’ networks that encourage ‘whales’ or ‘good-standing’ they are a scam of sorts since all they do is ‘track’ and ‘trace’ you to be ‘certified’ and ‘promoted’ sigh.,0

"It can't and it doesn't need to. When your body gets flooded with spikes, your immune system will kick in to learn how to fight them off. Once it learns how, memory cells will remain in your body.

"This is indeed a new technology to develop vaccines. Not going to argue about that. But the technology has never been completely abandoned. There have been setbacks along the way, but researchers have kept chipping away at them. Even today, research is ongoing to make it more stable (in higher temperatures) and they're looking at other ways to deploy it (eg to fight of cancer more effectively).",0

"Yes but they would need to keep the balance too which basically means they donate money away as everyone would cash out to be millionaire (and move to a new chain lol).  That is why also the idea exist to reward people based on their holdings, to avoid its mainly miners with only the intention to sell off right after.  I guess the functioning of mining simply shouldnt be lucrative or require much resources like TRON does. Fees are near zero. Tron also does 10,000 transactions per second while most others and Visa cards do just up to 1500.  Mark my words, highly undervalued coin.",0
"It’s not a ton, though. A figurative ton. But I think you mean “lot”.  The thing is that proof of stake is an authoritative model, which defeats the whole fucking point. Proof of work works because it would cost more to “fake” a valid block than it is to mine one.  That is constant. It will always be harder to fake a block then to find a proof.   However brilliant it is, the amount of computing power (not electricity, mind you) being wasted is immense. Which is why I invite everyone to find solutions for that. I’ve been working on it for a while but it’s a genuinely immense problem to solve, every solution fails in a way or another.  For a solution to be valid it needs to maintain the current model. ie: the existing hardware shouldn’t go to waste, the miner income shouldn’t be reduced.  But also deliver on factors beyond the model: utilisation of the hardware (there is nothing keeping us to replacing what today is “difficulty” which is synthetic with real equations we want to solve).  The amount of transactions in a block, in my opinion, should be fluid but the amount of work fixed.  This computing power shouldn’t be wasted. Replacing bitcoin makes all that work go to waste. Reducing rewards greatly inflate economies of scale. I’m also working on a non profit pool. The problem so far is that a fee is still needed for server cost and maintenance. That’s inacceptable, it should be part of the blockchain.",0
I think I must be misunderstanding this but: Under normal lending procedure: Lenders give money to borrowers - borrowers use capital to generate revenue - borrower makes payments to the lender using this revenue   If the money remains held in the smart contract until the ‘goals’ are met how do the lenders generate the money to meet the goals? I thought the reason for the borrowing is that upfront capital is needed to the generate revenue? Otherwise the borrower would have no need for it in the first place If anyone could explain where I’m going wrong :),0

"The experimental vaccines can cause pathogenic priming.  When you catch a cold, your body's immune system could go into a cytokine storm each time.  According to Moderna 2012 study, it is in your rna forever and ever, spreads to tissue and bone, and is considered genetic modification.  Since the product is synthetic with an mrna delivery system, my prediction is science won't be able to conquer a traditional medication therapy for your symptoms.   In two or three years we will definitely be able to tell who received the vaccines.  Remember, they skipped the animal studies and went right into human trials!  No recourse, complete protection from future liability. This would never happen had not the Government declare a national emergency.  This is why the drug companies never got it approved, in 20 years, until now!!   I wish you all very well.",0

"mRNA vaccines code for the antigen (protein), so in a way they are antigens. While your body may react slightly fast to an already made antigen, these antigens need to be engineered and grown, which for recombinant proteins involves a very slow and complex process, which can be avoided with mRNA vaccines.  Also, a big advantage of mRNA vaccines is that the antigens are made in healthy human cells, and therefore ""look"" very similar to the real virus proteins your body may encounter in an infection. In contrast, many antigen vaccines are grown in easy to culture animal cell or human cell line platforms.",0
"Sorry, there are several incorrect ao oversimplified statements in this video. Most alarming is the claim that out immunesystem only do us good. That is definitively not the case. The severe damaged in critical covid-cases, are in fact *caused* by our own immunesystem that 'overreacts'! In general -think about our immunesystem as 'fire'. Fire can be a great asset, when its *under control*. Out of control, it is very destructive! The immunesystem has 'similar behaviour'. I worst case scenario, the immunesystem kills you in the attempt to rid you of the 'foreign' thread, and often it a hair-thin balance. That was just one of several statements i did not like.",0
"The vaccine only works in ~a month -max, then it is not even existing in your body any more. All the responsibility for your defence is now depending on strong and viable clones of Tmemory-cells. Tm. That is the elegant function of vaccines. They initiate a response, that in fact initiates a next level response, as if there never had been any vaccine at all! Your body is a state where it *would* have been, IF you had survived a fatal decease. Because of the vaccination, you never have to fight the decease, but your immunesystem cant make any distinctions between you as 'survivor'  or you as vaccinated. You get the whole benefit from the vaccine alone. The only reason for you to not be able to fight SARS-CoV2 would be that your *specific clone* of Tm 'grows old' and stop proliferating, those effects can be seen 6-8 y after a vaccination.  In SARS-CoV2's example, that is however almost not possible, because there will be a subset of individuals, that denies to get the vaccine. Because of that, our immunesystem will constantly be 'reminded' about the antigen, and then Tm-clones do not 'fade out'. ...No ! The antivax nitwits are NOT doing 'us' a favour, the not-vaccinated population subset, is a severe risk of new variations of the virus, it is however not likely that the spike-protein will change, because that is in fact the virus' 'key' to the cells it need to attack. In a more speculative direction we could however 'get' a new virus, that attacks other cell-types, but retain some of SARS-CoV2 characteristics: *Spe-cu-la-tions*  wont happen I hope.....",0

Totally agree (Y),0
Getters and setters are mainly used to allow you to change underlying structure of your classes without affecting your application itself. Setters are also useful to do validation before accepting values in your application.,0
"I've visualized it as a real block for easier explanation. Of course a block is just a data structure, but it's hard to visualize that so that everyone will understand. As for your second question: blockchain is just a technology. The biggest cryptocurrencies use their own blockchain, while some are built on top of others.",0
"@Simply Explained when you say validations that makes sense. Still why have public class attributes then? Doesn't take make the attribute insecure !!! ? We can directly change it from outside using className.attribute = ""new value"" Doesn't that defeat the purpose of getters and setters in the first place?",0

"Well yeah, that's what's happening now. However, from what I've heard, preliminary studies seem to show that this vaccine will still work against all the current strains. It might work better against the older strains than the newer ones but it still provides some protection.   But the beauty of mRNA vaccines is that if the spike does radically change it'll be pretty easy to alter the sequence of the mRNA to protect against the new protein without really changing anything else in the manufacturing process.",0
"The second one. Basically the immune system is like ""what's this? That shouldn't be here."" and destroys the spikes. So if you get infected by covid later the immune system is like ""Oh that again. I know how to deal with this."" and targets the virus for destruction faster because it already has the immune infrastructure in place to deal with that target specifically.",0
"@Robert Falk Maybe a better analogy would be making a cake? If the virus is a cake with a few layers, then it's genome is a recipe book for making the whole cake and the mRNA in the vaccine is just the recipe for making the frosting on top.",0

"Ok, so just to bring about some caution- Bill Gates said in 2011 that he wants to reduce the population to 250 million and the best way is to do it by vaccines. Now 10 years later, do you think Bill Gates has changed? If he’s endorsing this Covid vaccine, do you think he’s doing it because he wants to save lives? I don’t think so. Just cause someone is injecting you with mRNA doesn’t make it safe because it’s a piece of genes being injected into you. you don’t know if they’re injecting you with a piece of material that creates “spikes” or creates a mutation that can make you have cancer, be infertile, or cause an autoimmune disease. Sure, if it’s just another “virus” they’re injecting you with, and you have a strong immune system, your body can fight it off. It’s concerning to me that they’re injecting older folks in nursing homes first. They’ll be the first to die from this vaccine. They said they’re injecting the US military next and then the US healthcare workers third. Now they’re starting to inject the general population of Americans. Their goal is to get 100 million - or about 1/3 of Americans vaccinated. What’s also interesting is that they’re not even working on a vaccine for children any time soon. So I guess their goal is to kill off all the weak, old and feeble people that can’t fight off disease and leave the children alone? The World Health Organization leaders are very fond of China- which ironically fabricated this virus in their lab in Wuhan. Don’t believe me? When it opened, it said it was one of the labs with the most dangerous pathogens studied and worked on. Somehow SARS “escaped” from that lab several years ago. But hey, I guess we have to get ready for a one world government soon with a one world currency, and China will be over the US and the US will be Communist controlled very soon.",1

"“This is not a vaccine. This is an mRNA packaged in a fat envelope, that is delivered to a cell. It is a medical device designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming a pathogen-creator. It is not a vaccine. “Vaccines are actually a legally-defined term and they’re a legally-defined term under public health law and they’re a legally-defined term under CDC and FDA standards and a vaccine, specifically has to stimulate both an immunity within the person receiving it but it also has to disrupt transmission. And that is not what this is. “They have been abundantly clear in saying that the mRNA strand that is going into the cell is not to stop transmission. It is a treatment. But if it was discussed as a ‘treatment’, it would not get the sympathetic ear of public health authorities, because then, people wold say, ‘Well, what other treatments are there?’ “The use of the term ‘vaccine’ is unconscionable…Remember, Moderna was started as a chemotherapy company for cancer, not as a vaccine manufacturer for SARS…",0

"IOTA is great. I am holding it since 2017. But: Hedera Hashgraph is the future of blockchain as well as DAG's. The next generation blockchain/DAG. Their Coin ""Hbar"" will go through the roof. I am confident that the consesus within ""The Council"" will be superior to centralized politics modes as well as a 100 % decentralized voting system. The votes should be in smart hands as well as the smart hands should change within a time period. Also it should be possible to reject a member. The speed is phenomenal and there is no real competitor. It is, different to IOTA, already working. No forking possible, which is great. ALL THIS is Hedera Hashgraph. I am very excited and big staked. As the community would say: To the MOOON!",0
So what if benign endogenous cells contain spikes? Will our immune systems attack them too?,0

Lovely explanation man! Hats off...,0
GET FEDERATED!,0
@Eihoofd2 I don't think replying to a 2 year old comment will get you very far. And if you'd actually watched the video you'd see that a very concise explanation of Bitcoin was given. Most likely what he was referring to.,0

So aids vaccine should work the same way?,0
They can't have these specific spikes until they encounter the vaccine. Our immune system will attack them and kill it. But we have billions of cells in our body so this won't matter in the scale of things,0

Are the spikes considered antigens?,0
VERY misleading . Really over simplified.  No explination about diseases ENHANCEMENT and pathogenic priming where people are going to possibly die and get more sick as a result of having had the vaccine from pathogenic priming which can lead to cytokine storm you should listen to Judy mikovich talk about this and professor Dolores Cahill and professor luc Montagnier,0
"Really nice video,congrats! But in proof of stake networks couldn't have ""pool""?  I can stake my coins in other's node,so he can have a higher chance to be a validator. This node could even have a 51% coin supply in staking,so he can control the blockchain. Does that make any sense or not?",0
"Wow, it took me like 10 years before I decided to look into what Blockchain actually means. Not as complicated as I imagined.",0
There's no indication that China 'created' the virus. Also: mRNA vaccines weren't developed by China.,0

There is just no way your average Joe can invest enough to see a good monthly return,  you are literally crossing your fingers and praying to god that your coins go up in value like crazy,  when PoW pays your average miner a decent amount daily that they can actually turn a profit without having to constantly dump their money into a wallet to earn cents.",0

"I have been writing a small one in Go, trying to figure out the garbage collection problem of the way that we currently define blockchains.  I am using an account-balance-with-nonce model for the simple coin; kind of like Ethereum (very simple to stop double-spending, easy to explain).    I immediately ran into the problem of trying to ensure that all amount flows sum to zero.  There has to be somebody in the system with negative balances; and that would be the mints.  That is either where something needs to be backed by an asset like Gold, or where you have to use Proof-of-work or something else to justify minting money.  The garbage-collection problem is hard.  The current systems hash the transactions that make up the database state.  It's possible to incrementally hash the database state; so that you can present a trash-compacted version of history that comes out to the same database.  This might work, because the whole point in this is just to force everyone to agree on a consistent database; when there is an incentive to fork into versions where people have their goods, but can un-spend their money.  I'm not so sure that going back all the way to Genesis is going to work in the long run; because it implies storing an infinite number of transactions.    So I am experimenting with using elliptic curves to incrementally hash a database state; in case the existing systems don't give you a horizon at which further validation into the past isn't justified.  (ie: don't iterate from Genesis forward.... Start from the block and database state that you have, and work transactions backwards until you find an inconsistency between current state versus previous state plus transaction.  There has to be a horizon at some point, where the Genesis block can be considered moved up.  With Bitcoin and unspent transactions output, I am not sure if you can move the Genesis horizon up to take out the trash.  You care about balances being perfect, and double-spending being impossible.  It's more a bug (ie: liability) than a feature that all the transactions must be hauled around by the whole world; forever.",0
"One of the big garbage collection issues is.... how to deal with trash from people losing their keys.  With a way to lease out a presence in the chain, and some kind of inheritence rule for lost funds; you could sustainably run a blockchain forever, within a fixed disk-usage size.  That's because there would be a garbage-collection horizon, and a way to deal with people that tax the blockchain with garbage.",0
only clarity that i see is that bitcoin now is 48.8k while watching this 1 year and 3 month old video :D,0
No one use Cardano. Unjustified hype,0
"Great stuff, well explained",0
That is the whole problem. You are being misinformed. The vaccine is 300 times more dangerous than the so-called pandemic. Do some research-and not on youtube which is censoring all pro-choice info on covid vaccines.,0

Yeah, go ahead and be a human guinea pig, but I shall not...esp for a mild coronavirus that normal folks will be fine with.  They literally screwed up every public health decision from the beginning and no want an entire population to take an experimental, untested lipid-mRna hybrid without allowing folks to forensically investigate.",0

"I address this question in my follow-up video: https://youtu.be/CfZjK2eIDFM The mRNA vaccines are less effective against the new variants, but still effective enough to offer protection.

"More specifically, from the Dutch part of Belgium ;) I do believe that Cardano has a lot of potential. But it hinges on how well they execute on their plan. Nothing is certain.",0
Your body does indeed remember the infection and protects you from it. How long that lasts is heavily debated/researched. Many papers agree that naturally made antibodies do fade away after X months.,0
The market does. High demand will drive the price up. Low demand / people selling will drive it back down.,0

"1.) New mRNA vaccines may change your DNA, permanently According to Dr. Miklos Lukacs de Pereny, a research professor of science and technology in Peru, the COVID-19 pandemic was manufactured by the world’s elites as part of a plan to globally advance “transhumanism” — literally, the fusion of human beings with technology in an attempt to alter human nature itself. Several scholars have been raising warning flags about this imminent possibility in respect to the coronavirus vaccines aggressively being rolled-out, particularly the Bill Gates-backed Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Dr. Carrie Madej, an internist trained in osteopathic medicine, has expressed her urgent concerns in several videos, and interviews which have gained a strong circulating presence on social media for several months now.  Both of these vaccines use a new “messenger RNA” technology (mRNA), which Madej states is important to know, “because it could potentially alter our DNA, our genome.” And our human genome is what separates us from animals and plants. It is our “blueprint” for how we develop, reproduce, function and repair ourselves. Therefore, “one little change one little protein inserted, one taken out, can actually create a congenital defect or a hereditary disorder.” This process is called “transfection” and is the “same technology being used to make a genetically modified organism, such as a tomato or corn in the grocery store,” Madej said. Such modified organisms “are not as healthy as the organic the wild type that you see out in nature,” thus, potentially, “we would not be as healthy.” Dr. Lukacs points out how similar DNA modifying experiments have been performed on human embryos already. Culture-of-death scientists have been “mixing genes with humans from monkeys and rats, with pigs because we want to harvest organs…” and then killing the embryos after 14 days. The public is told, he says, that with respect to these vaccines, the mRNA “will go into the cell and instruct the DNA to code a particular protein, which will then fight against the virus.” “But who can certify [for] us that this is the type of RNA they are manufacturing?” he asked. As the vaccine could carry RNA to do just about anything, including limiting “our capacity to capture oxygen in the red (blood) cells,” or disrupt the “physiological process where you have to develop sperm. You never know. The sky is the limit,” he said. As has long been an ethical concern with human genome research, the virtually limitless possibilities of this technology can be horribly abused. Such processes may be able to even compromise other features, such as one’s intelligence, and that of their offspring, creating even a class of sub-humans by combining human DNA with that of animals. While vaccine manufacturers have denied that the mRNA in these vaccines will change one’s genome, Dr. Louis Fouché, a French anesthetist and resuscitation specialist said this can’t be known until it happens and we have long-term studies, highlighting another grave concern with such a rushed vaccine. In response to the same assertion, Dr. Madej, adds that with their expression of certainty on this question, these corporations are simply “outright lying.”",0
"Great vid! I had a question about VPN though. You mentioned that if you're connected to the coffee shop's wifi, all your traffic is unencrypted and visible to other computers on the wifi network. So when you set up a vpn, surely there is an interim period where your traffic is visible before the vpn is enabled right? And how does the signal flow work in this scenario?

"Hi,  thanks for the video, although the colorblind example doesn't really work? The objective was to prove to the color blind person that the balls were two different colors. But the colorblind person could have been lied to each time by the woman since he can't validate the color himself.  Perhaps the example would've been better framed as, a group of color-seeing people individually vote on the green ball. If the balls were the same color, the group wouldn't be able to all vote for the same ball, proving to the colorblind dude that, in fact, the balls are of two different colors. And separately, the non-interactive zero proof wasn't really explained? And you also mention at one point that it's beneficial because it's quick for nodes to process, but then later describe it as process intensive. Clarity here would be appreciated. Thanks!",0

What about prior immunity from either already having had it or from other coronaviruses? Wish it were all so nice and simple, but the machinery of the immune system is incredibly complex and isn't down to a few binary ""change this and that happens"" type events. It is interconnected and multifaceted, much of it is still not completely understood. So I'll wait until the technology is tested and proven and the disease merits the risk if that's all the same to you. Thanks",0

@Stella M  The profit-motivated rush to deploy mRNA vaccines to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus is causing regulators and researchers to skip (or accelerate) many critical steps in quality control and clinical trials.

That virus will get into the human cell itself. However, how can we make sure that the mRNA gets into the cell in order to create spike proteins for making people getting immunized? Otherwise, won't the mRNA just fell to some empty spaces between the cells? Could you reply to this question?  I really would like to know about this >_<. Thanks!",0

"I can think of one zero-knowledge proof that is non-interactive that involves proving that one knows the prime factors of a number without revealing said prime factors, basically it's RSA signing with a twist. It goes like this:     Say you have the number N = 128423, and you want to prove that you know the prime factors without revealing any information about the primes themselves. Here's what you do   1. Since you know the factors are  769 * 167 = 128423, you can calculate the Euler totient to get (769-1) * (167-1) = 127488, we'll call this value _phi._ 2. Now pick a public number _e_ which is coprime to phi, the easiest is a number like 65537 which is prime but greater that the square-root of phi. 3. Now calculate a secret number _d_ by taking the modlular inverse of _e_ modulo phi, this gives us 1/65537 = 54785 (mod 127488). 4. If we take any number _m_ and raise it to the power _d_ then do modulo N to get a new numer _s,_ doing the same with _s_ but with _e_ instead of _d_ we arrive back at _m._    m ^ d (mod N) = s s ^ e (mod N) = m For any m < N   We can calculate _s_ only by knowing _d,_ and knowing _d_ (combined with _e,_ which is public) is equivalent to knowing the factors of N.     Finally, let's try a practical example to demonstrate:   Here is a proof I know the prime factors of the number 5609654452760709630006622756892418841890735941208888880805793565319940075849799980043767420213243893:    N = 5609654452760709630006622756892418841890735941208888880805793565319940075849799980043767420213243893 e = 65537 s = 4691398041935726800648528142580678766790089967215103950511154552099580646783686977287224608076011797   The signature _s_ is of the number you get by coverting ""Hello, World!"" into ASCII-encoded binary taking the result as a number in base 2. That is, _m_ = encode(""Hello, World!""), _s_ = m ^ d (mod N). You can check this proof by taking  _m_ = s ^ e (mod N), then decoding m.    Unless I was *extremely* good at guessing, calculating _s_ is impossible without first knowing the prime factors of N.",0

When the virus hit my home we were not prepared we had not done a research and my son's symptoms were worse than mine he went to the Banner hospital emergency room in Glendale Arizona because he was scared they told him he had pneumonia they gave him antibiotics and prednisone within 3 days I had to call 911 he was hospitalized intubated and died I was shocked I had to find the answers took me a while to do the research and then going to the hospital information portal I even had his medical records released and I could clearly see where they had given him a wrong diagnosis and if they would have with the report like I did they wouldn't have missed the details that they did but they were too much of in a hurry to get them out and as soon as they saw covid they assume pneumonia when they were actually looking at the residual effects of covid he was about one day or two from being covered free the lawyers will not touch the cases I confronted the hospital with their protocol and they said they did not have a protocol but just a suggestion well some suggestion it cost my son's life it would have been better for him to go home with covid information and have him follow up with his doctor he would still be alive today but we trusted them and we believe the lie with the vaccine it's coming out too soon too fast and I believe it'll hurt more people than help them because I'm sure the details that they see in a vaccine that takes 10 years to bring out are not in this vaccine and there's a lot of details that they don't know I'm not believing this lie I will not be taking the vaccine,0

These symptoms are are outcome of the body trying to fend of an “infection” your body temperature is raised higher to fight off these virus proteins thus you experience chills and fevers. The process of fighting these virus proteins produced by the mRNa causes these symptoms but since the virus spike protein dont contain the live viral generic material there isnt any replication or prolong infection so the severity and time of the symptoms are reduced once all the spike proteins are neutralized,0

"*2-27-21* *A million questions* : What ifs, long term questions,  and predictions. I am not a scientist,  but I do know how those vaccine *trials*  turned out. NONE of us know what's going to be happening in  2022 with our bodies. *No one* . Stop asking. *Relax* . We will get through this! I do feel that a vaccine may be a yearly event. *Until then* ,  I will continue to educate myself by keeping up to date on the most recent *facts*  on the  vaccines. I am not wondering around my city asking myself, *or* my doctor,  a million questions about what will happen to me after I get the vaccine,  because he is only going to repeat the *facts*  that I am already aware of ( *I hope* ). He's reading like I'm reading. He's learning like I am learning. I am at peace with my health,  prior to vaccine, and afterward. I still have to be good to myself. The vaccine is not a cure all. It's not even a cure for Covid-19. *There is no cure yet folks* . It is because of my *faith*  that *I think like this* :We know what we know. We will know more as time goes on. The virus is new to *everyone* , so no one will be able to answer about long term until time passes (long term).  I'm learning as I keep it moving. They did their trials. I didn't hear about anyone dying with them, but some had side affects. That's what we know. That's what the experts know. That's what my doctor know. Knowing that, I will pray that God keeps me here a long time. If he is ready for me, it's going to happen, *even if*  I don't get the vaccine. I am ready to get another step closer to visiting my family and friends without worrying about getting sick from Covid-19.  *It's an individual choice*  that a person will just have to decide on. When a certain amount is vaccinated, the masks *will*  come off. I *am not*  going to be one of those  paranoid (in store,on plane,in church, visting loved ones),  and *still wearing a mask, when CDC makes it optional*  for those vaccinated, for *fear*  that I may catch the Covid-19 . My eyes are on the future. I place *any* fear, with my *faith* .  Making travel plans with much more ease now. Stay safe.  God bless our world! Sorry about the length,  good people!",0
That's the theory ... let's talk about the practical side: What if the vaccine contains errors in the instructions sent to the cells? this is actually a real concern because it is a possibility whenever we talk about mass chain production,0

@Bakezonline I think it could easily go up to 3-5 per coin with in the next 1 to 2 years.  I'm no expert but I believe in the platform and idea and I think alot of other people do too.

Our bodies already have our own mRNA in it, which is based off your DNA being read by complex mechanisms. This mRNA of our own is then read and proteins which give us our bodily functions and characteristics are produced. This vaccine just gives our body an extra set of instructions to read. It stays separate from our actual DNA. There is no mutation, just a ""How-to"" manual.",0

I can't imagine, at least presently, that computer code can address whether construction work on a commercial building is completed satisfactorily at each stage of construction such that money can be disbursed per the contract conditions.

Anything requiring satisfaction of multiple conditions, such as a home purchase (inspections, financing, title evaluation, repairs, move-in inspection) would seem well beyond the capability of computer code, except to record and preserve the situation via inputs at the time.

@Roger Diotte Oooof! Thats hella hefty for the initial cost. How is that compared to the normal cable ISPs? Is it better speedwise vs cost?,0
"@Hamsik Armino Well here's the story, first off we live where there is no other options (no cable, no fiber). The whole point of Starlink is for people like me that have no options. Obviously if we had cable or fiber we wouldn't be here. Hooking up with Cable/Fiber would be the correct way to go if you have those options because you don't pay those initial costs (800 dollars) and it's likely you would have plans under 100 dollars/mnth on them carriers.  So since Starlink is our only option then it's worth every cent to us! As for sure comparisons to my closest city, for the same price I pay here I could have Gigabit speeds in the city so no I don't get those speeds with Starlink however I get 100mbps speeds average which is beyond anything that's out here!",0
@Roger Diotte Ah i get it. Would do the same if i was in your position. Is that the least package pricing? What about the 600 mbps mentioned in the video?,0
Can you load javascript from the bucket or just css?,0
?  They not only exist but vast amounts of the world’s population have already been vaccinated with them Honestly.....,0
"@Hamsik Armino It's a one price deal with Starlink, no tiers (atleast not yet) I've not managed to get 600 yet but that's the promise apparently. I'm usually around 80 on average but I do see as high as 130. In all honesty though I don't care what they do in the future as of right now I'm always able to stream 4k video on all my TV's and use the internet at full speed so I'm good with what it is now! I can browse ROKU movies and watch their TV free, I can flip through any YouTube content and click away, I can fire up a game online and play, we can go online to school and stream video.

"You said “not the actual virus, just the spike itself”, meaning that your body is only producing the part responsible for attaching to cells. Since your body is only learning how to attack the spike, and not the actual virus, how is this effective? The virus would be foreign and your body would have never come in contact with it.   And to anyone saying “the spike contains or is part of the virus”, no it’s not.

This hasn't convinced me to get the vaccine. It all sounds shady to me. I don't want any mRNA invading my cells to give them instructions to build a foriegn substance in my body. No thank you! We don't know the long term effects of the vaccine. They released it without proper study being done.,0
I've been watching your videos recently. They are very helpful and simplifed. Thank for great contents!,0
Centralisation is not the solution,0
"The spikes are the part of the virus that latches on to your cells, it's pretty much like a key gaining access to your cells to replicate itself. When your injected with the spikes/vaccine your immune system recognizes it as something that was not made in your body and creates antibodies that latch on to the protein spikes Preventing the viruses from latching on to your cells thus not letting it replicate. Each virus has distinct protien spikes, flu spikes are different from ebola, earlier covid spikes are different from the mutated versions. If the coronavirus spikes mutate even more the vaccines will be ineffective because the mutated protien spikes will be completely different from what people are getting injected with.   I'm sure there is more to the vaccine that the scientists are not telling us about because it's been killing people all over the world.",0
This is centralization of each person's data to each person. Not exactly centralization.,0

"@Péter Winkler  besides the fact everything is in one place (password managers already exist so that's not news), if the system doesn't support feeding different vendors different data under the same alias, and a company locks you from using their product unless you share something like your address or ID number, it is actually harder than it previously was to keep your data safe. Right now if a company wants to force you to provide certain data they have to adjust their system to force that and store that data, and there's no guarantee it's valid, while if this system becomes widely available they need no extra effort to block you out.    I recently got back into cryptocurrencies since 2017, to find out that every legalized method of purchasing any cryptocurrency requires you to provide every single personal detail about you (address, and copy of your ID), at least for my country. What used to be a step towards greater privacy for the consumer is now less secure than cash purchases.

"mRNA (messenger RNA) is essentially an instruction of what proteins to build. These mRNA vaccines has codons of instructions on how to build the spike proteins that COVID19 viruses have which they use to attach to hosts' cells. So using the mRNA blueprint, it tells your cells to build and express the spike proteins which then your B-cells (memory cells) can recognize and prepare antibodies for. Once your immune system learns to recognize these spike proteins, it will be ready if you get infected with COVID. The B-cells will trigger the appropriate antibodies to attack the virus and destroy. The main issue is that COVID19 mutates time to time (in order to sustain better), creating different versions of these spike proteins.",0

"@Robert Falk Do you have any credible evidence for that, I'd be interested in reading the paper.  All I can find are articles in newspapers primarily interested in selling copies, not spreading the truth.",0
The former. Cells produce proteins all of the time. It's just here they've been re-programmed by the mRNA in the vaccine to produce the spikes- which are just protein.,0

"@Michael Morehouse I don't believe that, but we'll see.  As for the returns of those who got in early, by that logic, all successful startups would be Ponzi schemes.",0
"@John Chan no, they wouldn’t, because the startups are producing something of direct economic value (well, for any startup that isn’t actually a Ponzi scheme), and the startup investor’s returns are based on either enterprise profits (for dividends) or market value of a proof of stake at transfer (stock appreciation). In a proof of work blockchain there’s the miners, who have no direct equivalent in a startup... they literally expand the share pool of a venture that makes nothing by exploiting energy arbitrage opportunities, then they sell shares they’ve created out of thin air to late investors who purchase with cash, hoping those shares will appreciate because of FOMO demand pressure. The whole engine transfers late investors who stake in cash into the hands of early investors who stakes in mining pools... it’s a very modern twist on a Ponzi scheme. Proof of stake blockchains seem to be less schemish, especially ones with strong emphasis on smart contracts and the ledger itself as the product, rather than the token, but still as investment it’s a weird kind of risk... pretty much nobody actually understands that they’re banking on a very slow massively distributed database with eternally growing storage constraints that can be taken out by a substantial magnetic pulse or decent size solar storm. Plus everyone just seems to assume that network and mining pool attacks are economically infeasible when the proposal that you can just make up money is central to the idea.

"@Peter Bernhard Ah my mistake, I misunderstood your original question. Here's the answer to that. Virus reproduction goes through several stages: Attachment, Penetration, Uncoating, Replication, Assembly and finally the Virion release stage.  The Virion release stage is what you're asking about. This can happen in two ways, either the cell lyses (breaks apart) releasing the virions, or they are released by budding which is less destructive and sort of a reverse of the process of penetration.",0

"I received dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine on 01.23.2021 and dose 2 on 02.13.2021. I took an antibody test on 11 March 2021. Should I have expected the 11 March test for antibodies to be positive for antibodies? And what does it mean if it wasn't? (It was not positive for antibodies.) One more piece of information for others more knowledgeable than I and kind enough to comment. Prior to the vaccine I tested negative for COVID-19 several times and took one test for antibodies months before. All were negative. My bottom line curiosity is are you supposed to test positive for antibodies after having been fully vaccinated and did something go awry if you don't even after the appropriate time elapses?

While it is true that if they had the foresight to buy at economy of scale rates at the beginning, it would have favored them, that ship has sailed.  If part of the bargain to shift from proof of work, to proof of stake, is that we also use it on a lesser adopted currency, this seems to offer the rich another crack at bat now that the money is in it.    I'd rather give them a slight advantage at procuring the last 3 million BTC while 18 million is more distributed than give them the opportunity to have an advantage based on who can come up with the biggest deposit, on the vast majority of the future total of a new crypto.",0

Kinda coin value is pointless from my perspective, it's just people printing money, but till every one uses just coins for purchase we have to convert to usd or eur so then value is again controled by goverment. So every contry then needs to use one type of coin in orded for no value to be controled by goverment.

You mentioned that this is done in crypto projects to reduce the current supply, but how is the supply effectively reduced if the money is ""waiting"" in a wallet that has not been made by anyone? The blockchain does not know, as you point out, that this wallet has not been made yet, so it has no idea whether some guy, e.g. you, will show up in the future to claim the money or not. So, I just don't see why the money is gone, using your previous logic! It must be something I'm missing here =) Thank you so much for explaining",0

"While you've done the opposite of _sell_ me on the idea of Proof of Stake, you did explain it simply as your channel name promised, so thank you.",0
"Yes but checking (validating) a block is extremely cheap in comparison to mining it. So cheap that its basically ignored. Both PoW and Pos require validating a new block in the same way. The difference is that in proof of work billions of calculations are done ""guessing"" the hash of the next block, and each guess requires a validation step to see if it was correct or not, and once that miner knows it has the correct answer it notifies all the others, who each run their own validation calculation. In Proof of Stake, it sounds like the guessing process is skipped entirely.  (disclaimer: i don't support Proof of Stake, I'm still learning about it. I'm just elaborating on the validation step)",0
"@Steven Sevieria Its understandable that the video creator would misspeak, however its also understandable why this would really confuse someone learning about this for the first time. He basically said the opposite of what he meant lol",0
"Not sure I can answer everything here, but ""consensus"" is achieved indirectly in Bitcoin: when you guess a block's hash, its broadcasted to all the other miners who can choose to accept or reject it. If they accept it, then their copy of the blockchain is the same as yours. If they reject it, then their copy of the blockchain starts to diverge from yours. So how does a 3rd party pick which blockchain is real? They pick the longer one. Who will have the longer one? Usually whoever has more computing power. So ""consensus"" on which blockchain is legitimate is determined by computing power. If a party has 51% of the computing power, then others are most likely to accept their version of the blockchain, would theoretically allow them to double-spend, or block transactions of parties they don't like.",0
Couldn't some governments meet that 51% requirement for an attack on POS?,0

"I'm no expert but I would imagine because after the first jab your immune system sees these spikes, it's never seen them before and there is a delay to the reaction. In those few days it creates B Cells to kill them off and recognise them in the future.  These same B Cells recognise the spikes created by the second jab and react immediately in the same way they would for a real virus, high temperature being a typical response to an invader, it may slow replication. It soon works out it's not threatening, it kills them off easily with the B Cells because it doesn't replicate and the response fades.  Makes some kind of sense to me :)",0

"mRNA gene altering technology was introduced world-wide in November 2020.  There is no going back now for those who have allowed themselves to be made a part of this DNA editing experiment.  In an article in Scientific America in 2018 it exposed that they needed an excuse to start expanding their research in altering Humans.  In January 2020 they created the “EMERGENCY” that removed ALL restraints from testing on humans and they are not even liable for any harm they cause.  The following is from Scientific America.  “November 2018, a Chinese scientist, He Jiangxi, caused an international uproar by announcing the birth of two babies whose DNA he had edited using a tool called CRISPR-Cas9. Human germline genome editing—that is, making precise changes in human DNA that can be passed down through generations—has been seen for decades as a line that should not be crossed. This past December, He was sentenced to three years in prison for carrying out an “illegal medical practice.” Yet, as the Chinese experiment shows, the state of technology no longer bars those who are willing to cross it. He’s experiment was a profound scientific and ethical misstep. Not only did he do it before adequate preparatory studies had been undertaken, but he acted unilaterally, deploying a technology with the potential to affect deeply held beliefs about human life all around the planet. His experiment set a dangerous example for other overly eager scientists. In mid-2019, a Russian scientist proposed a similar experiment. We cannot blame lax oversight on China alone. The scientist who carried out the controversial first experiment in China was trained at U.S. universities using science and technology developed in the U.S., and he consulted with U.S. colleagues before conducting his study. Yet, so far we have largely let prominent scientists and scientific institutions frame the discussion around genome editing.”",0

"@Clemence Williams I hope you don't mind me correcting you there.  Plasma cells are actually just another name for effector B cells. I'd say they're still B cells that just has a different function than their counterpart, memory B cells. Both differentiate after activation which can occur either through direct contact with the pathogen or stimulation by an effector helper T cell. Both memory and effector B cells still produce antibodies, but what makes memory T cells different is that if they encounter the pathogen again, they differentiate into effector cells without going through the long process.",0

"One problem is that the Y shaped antibodies (called in the literature non-neutralizing antibodies because they loosely bind to the mRNA injected program encased in an artificial lipid called ""hydrogel"" and then release the mRNA inside the cytoplasm where it is released to mass produce itself) also ""attack"" the type 2 white blood cells in the lungs (using the FAC stem of the antibody) which essentially do   1). the clean up work after the more aggressive type 1 white blood cells which are extremely aggressive in attacking pathogens which cause infections and  2). shut down the type 1 white blood cells to prevent them from killing the host.  In animal studies involving mRNA vaccines it was found that after the pathogen supposedly protected by the vaccine that 100% of the treatment group animals died after exposure to the pathogen in question.  The lungs examined found only type 1 white blood cells and NO type 2 white blood cells.  In the control group (the animals that did not get the mRNA vaccine) and were ALSO exposed to the pathogen, both type 1 AND type 2 white blood cells were found in the lungs and 100% of these test animals survived.  Also according to the CDC's own statistics within the first 30 days of the introduction of the mRNA vaccine into the US over 40,000 cases of adverse effects were documented ant that is estimated as less than 1% of what ""they"" believe actually occurred.

"@G5rry No.That is how it is usually understood, but that is not the original intent.  Relational databases are named for the mathematical concept a relation. A relation is defined as a set of tuples. For example the < relation is a set of pairs of numbers. What 1 < 2 means is that the pair (1, 2) belongs to this set.  A table in a relational database is a set of tuples, a relation. A relational database is a database consisting of tables, where every row of a table has the same fields. Relational does not mean that it has forreign keys.",0
"@G5rry My point is that the greater number of indexes you build on a given file, the greater the overhead on the underlying system that maintains them. Every time a user runs a unique query, a new index must be built. As a result, there's a point at which it's more efficient on the system as a whole to access the data in another method, or even to restructure the data.   This isn't to say that SQL is always an inappropriate solution, G5rry. Or that it doesn't have value. It's an efficient solution in many cases, dependent upon the weight of the overall index maintenance. The ""always been tremendously inefficient"" was preceded by large, although the kind that I'm thinking of have actually been huge, rather than just large. I overstated my case.",0

The file size was 16X IBM's max at that time, even after data compression & spanning multiple hard drives!  So part of the hash was which of the 16 physical files the data was in.  In testing we achieved an average of 1.07 physical (system level) read requests per logical application request -- before a cache was added!  Code was also tight -- about 50 Assembly Language instructions to calc physical record # (or block), and about 70 AL / machine instructions within the IBM access method (BDAM) to convert our record # to CHR (Cylinder / Head / Record).  This was still in use in the 1990's.",0

"I’m struggling to get how actual data would work in a NoSLQ database. For instance what would the orders example (order, customer, product) look like in a NoSQL database?

You don’t know that every order record even has a price value? And output columns wouldn’t line up because each “order” could have a completely different set of columns from the next one?",0

"@Boomer Z FileCoin is literally designed to be the opposite way around lmao. It is to give people an incentive to use IPFS and serve those files. Additionally, having a browser-mined coin for those _viewing_ but not _serving_ would accomplish nothing. The entire purpose of IPFS is to have people download and serve to increase availability (and as a result, speed). Additionally, it's pretty peer-to-peer. If I visit an IPFS-enabled website, I download the stuff it needs, then serve them myself (until I delete it ofc).  Also, they can't really close down or block IPFS, which is also what it was designed for. I mean, how can they block it? Just look at BitTorrent, they aren't able to block that either and well, torrents are far, far more notorious for illegal stuff. They can't close it down either, because it's open-source, so people would just fork and continue on as usual.  And it probably already hosts a bunch of illegal stuff, you can never prevent that. Then again, every ""censorship resistant protocol"" is prone to this. Just look at ActivityPub (which is a W3C-recommended protocol), BitTorrent, TOR (more or less), Most cryptocurrencies etc. etc. And even *if* you manage to block it, it's a matter of time before a workaround will be found, which is exactly why those protocols are so powerful.",0

"@UCv3D-0cNQeL7BRPE5RpO2LA Correlation does not equal causation. IPFS can be ran standalone just fine like I do. It wasn't designed to give more money to the whales, it's just a side-effect of FileCoin, which is a seperate project.  Also, I never said IPFS was *fast*, I only said that by having more people serve a file, the *faster* it becomes. Faster, being a relative term.  Also, they haven't blocked torrents lmao. In Germany, you can torrent just fine (I use torrents to send stuff like documents and some tools I made between a bunch of friends). Yes, they have blocked sites like TPB but they have not blocked the BitTorrent protocol. They can fine you based on things like finding you in the DHT for a specific (known illegal) file and/or scraping you from trackers. They can't fine you for using the protocol itself (else using the Blizzard Launcher would get you fined since that uses the BitTorrent protocol under the hood as well).  Also, they can't really done it that easily. How would they? Blocking IPFS specifically would mean blocking the underlying connection protocol (be it TCP/IP or UDP). They can block commonly used ports, but at that point, just swap ports. They can block every port but the ones they allow, but at that point, a lot of different stuff will also start breaking.  The Great Firewall of China does exactly this, block a lot of ports and only allowing a select few, that they can monitor heavily (for obvious reasons). Do that in, let's say Germany or The Netherlands and well... you're bound to cause massive uproar.

Human mRNA does not stay in the nucleus for long at all, leaving once it has finished being made, so why would an already made virus mRNA have any reason to go into the nucleus?

"Awful misinformation.  1) Data partitioning was introduced in sql rdbms in the 1990's, and it constantly extended since then. (baded on hash, vatue, time, etc)  2) Sharding of complete sql rdbms was introduced since 2010. And even before that, there were ""distributed rdbmd"", were you _may_ have to code some conflict resolution, if necessary. With nosql, that's what you begin with, mendatorily at day 2.  3) In the very moment, one data atom has just one hint of relation to another data atom, and both are stored as key-value/nosql data lumps, you are lost: A change happens? Good luck finding all lumps that need to be changed as well, and not forgetting some. New to the kv-data/nosql-store? Good luck reading and understanding all the code, that if, _if_ it's readable (ie source fully available, well written, no tricks, no dynamic code generation, not too many lines). If zo extend/change a unknowm system's data handling, it's hard/ impossible, if the truth is buried in the code, not in the data model. And giod luck findingvand fixing bugs in conjuntion to nosql.  You nosql guys always forget, that you are no gods: Nobody codes perfect, no system does not change, you don't know next year's or decade's usage of the data you just lump together, you don't live forever, and costumers are extremely unwise to rely on individuals and there tricks.

"In MongoDB,  a document (aka a row in SQL) will be right {""order"": 111, ""customer"": ""xxx"", ""product"": ""yyy""}. As you mention, NoSQL doesn't guarantee the fields must be the same, there are two options for MongoDB developers. First, just remain them the same, when you query them with ""price greater than $100"", documents whose price doesn't exist will be ignored. However, if you sort documents by price ascendingly without any filter, the null price documents will be shown first, but you can fix it by adding filter {""price"": {""exists"": True}}. Second, in the case you really want MongoDB to guarantee the fields must the same, you may use the feature called ""validation"". It allows developers to control which fields are must-have and strict data types (number, string, etc.) for each field or which fields are free to insert.",0

"NoSQL is great for pizza sites. For everything else, there's SQL.",0
The easy going explanation so far.,0
You can use any hash function you want.,0
"Yes, this was fixed on GitHub. Can't update the video though.",0
"In most NoSQL databases, records are read as a whole (some have support for partial reads). That being said, records in NoSQL databases are usually limited in size.",0
The easiest I've used (and still do for my home stuff) is Pick of the same era.,0
That's *exactly* how such a request is made to a Pick database (since c. 1965). .,0
"It depends upon the hash formula used, particularly how the hash value is assigned to the groups.  In [the] Pick[s I've used] the hash value of the item ID is taken modulo the number of groups.  To change the number of groups requires copying the data to a new file created with the new modulo (often done on a system restore, eg when a new 16 port board had been added).  In the multivalue database I use at home it auto resizes by using a hashing algorithm that always allocates an item ID to the same bucket but many buckets can be stored in each primary group of the file (making use of hash collision), and when a group requires splitting, an extra primary group is added to the file and the items in the bucket(s) that should be in this new group are split from the group they were in.  Similarly when the file shrinks and primary groups are no longer needed, the reverse occurs combining two ""related"" groups.",0
"Pick works quite well with hashing to a group which then stores the whole of the data item, with multiple items in a group just stored one after the other in the group,  linking extra frames from the overflow spare frames of disk space.  A file with 23 groups is guaranteed to have hash collision with 24 items stored in it...",1
"In Pick the primary (only) key is the Item ID (denoted as attribute (or field) 0).  The item ID can be anything you like.  When an item is stored in a file a hash function is performed on this item ID which is then used to determine into which group (partition) of the file to place the item.  When accessing the data in a file, an attribute of the file can contain the item ID (primary key) of an item in another file.   You can define ""dictionary"" items which can pull data from another file based on the item ID found in the given attribute of an item in the current file.  Each Pick file is like a SQL table, except that no structure is imposed on each table (upto the programmer to ensure data integrity) and each attribute can be multivalue - eg an attribute of a customer can contain a list of their orders and when listing the customer file those orders can all be accessed from the single customer entry, pulling across the attributes as required (similar to, but not quite the same as a sql join).",0
"It happened back in 1965... _before_ SQL.  (Have a look at the history of the Pick database (operating system), the MUMPS database and SQL database.)",0
"A mail order retailer used a Pick system to handle its orders, stock control and accounts.",0
@Andre Duarte  And what holds the 0 group?  They describe the hash of 101 groups 0-100...,0
"That is an irrelevant question.  What about group 0 which is shown?  The video is an overview which suggests that the groups could be split between servers.  The exact apportioning of groups would be solved at the implementation time and could depend upon factors not mentioned in the video.  Whether it is 0-50 to one server, 51-100 to the other, or 0-39 to one and 40-100 to the other is beyond the scope of this video.",0
"That's never been a worry on the Pick systems I've used - if you have a customer with a list of orders they've placed and one of the orders gets deleted from the orders file, it would be a ""dangling reference"".  When you create a dictionary item to pull the data, you can specify what to do if the data is unavailable; get if possible otherwise: 1) return the item ID that couldn't be found 2) return a null (blank) value 3) abort with an error.",0

"@slooob23 Speaking of your comment of risking lives for the almighty dollar.  I've been studying how these vaccines work, and the many potential pitfalls this last year.  One thing I keep seeing in the normie friendly releases is that this is a big money saving benefit for pharma, if they can use synthetic, or largely synthetic gene based vaccines.  They can do it quicker, saving money, they they don't have to take months to culture viruses, more money saved. At our expense, they'd like the quickest cheapest route to bio-engineer some still poorly understood, and not at all long range tested, gene therapies. There's a Canadian vaccine scientist, Dr. Byram Bridle,who addresses a NZ host and your island's situation.  His Feb./21 presentation is very candid, on pitfalls of these undertested therapies.  He's searchable on YT for now and other alt media.",0

"The vaccines were not rushed?  1) none of the vaccines are FDA approved. Why? Because they haven’t had enough time to meet the FDA approval process which REQUIRES assessing the side effects over time. The vaccines are under “emergency use only”  2) Ever hear the saying that 9 women can’t have a baby in 1 month?  Some things can’t be “accelerated” by parallel activities. Clinical trials are called “trials” for a reason. The effects need to be assessed over short-term AND long term. None of the trials have date for long term effect, for pregnant women, for immune-suppressed etc.  that is why none of the vaccines are FDA approved.   That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get it. Everyone has different health situation and risk tolerance. But saying blankety “they are tested and safe” is an oversimplification and simply not true.",0

Good Explaination,0
@Simply Explained 1st. No mention of CRISPR Technology being used in the vaccines. the technology that is used to edit/ alter genes aka Human DNA.,0
@Lark MacGregor No its a DNA vaccine or to be more precise a gene therapy and not a vaccine in the strict sense of the word. The adenovirus DNA in the gene therapy enters your cells nuclei where the DNA coding for the spike protein is transcribed to the mRNA which will produce the spike protein by a process known as translation. Apologies for the rushed info on molecular biology but for people who are concerned start doing your own research because you are simply not being told everything and in some instances lied to.,0
"@JeffPaulTv1 CRISPR is not in the vaccine itself. Some vaccines are made with the aid of CRISPR, but it's not that technology that enters your body. -> It's not because you cook with pans and pots, that there are pans and pots in your food.  In my follow-up video I addressed the concerns about altering human DNA. The messenger RNA can enter our cells, but cannot enter the cell nucleus (where our DNA is stored).  Kind reminder to mention your sources. Then we can all check it out, read it, and decide for ourselves ;)",0
Thank you! Exactly what I needed. Concise and informative! All the other people just brag about it “for hours”!,0
51% attack is also NOT profitable thus not probable for PoW as largely discussed by aantonop...,0
@Simply Explained  Its honestly too much to write in a comment section. Plus I work directly with the CRISPR research department at my job.   some links I could send that'll backup my claims you need passwords to get in because its from the hospital systems  When you’re genetically modify something you create a proprietary thing. GMO crops is how they patent food and mRNA gene editing platform injection is how you patent human beings.,0
@Alex Besogonov You're missing the point. There's no doubt that AWS can withstand massive DDoS attacks but they're going to charge you for it.

Sometimes the provider will waive that charge but not everybody is as lucky.,0
"The unpredictability of the ""serverless"" provider's policies and the unpredictability of the costs of using their service makes this an absolute no-go for our business. There are way too many nightmare stories of people checking their account in the morning to only realize that their provider has charged them for multiple tens of thousands of dollars due to an unpredictable event or, even worse, a simple programming mistake.",0
"hey Gireesh, been 10 months. Did you set up your instance?",0

"@Lark MacGregor The list is endless. Passive cloth masks offering no protection to the wearer or those around them from virus particles whether in aerosols or not. Mask wearing known to cause more harm than good as demonstrated in previous flu pandemics where more people died due to infections caused by masks than the flu itself. People forced to where masks containing graphene particles. None of these issues on masks alone are being reported fully or allowed to be discussed in full allowing people to make up their own minds. We could go back and forth disagreeing on this and all areas of this so called Covid-19 pandemic and that is fine to a point.

Hello 👋,0
Dutch sub please,0
"thanks for the effort in creating your video-- a few extremely important facts to consider: 1.  Assuming that everyone on earth got infected, we know that 94% of deaths were from people who had 2.9 comorbidities (directly from the CDC's website).  So the 2% ratio average is inaccurate and dramatically skews the death total you projected. 2.  MRNA vaccines have not been approved by the FDA.  If you go to the FDA factsheets, you'll see them listed as unapproved,  for emergency release only.   3.  We don't know the long-term effects these synthetic biologics have on our immune systems because this is the first time they've been used on humans and especially en masse.  We actually don't know how each person will develop their unique responses over time which could lead to severe autoimmune issues.   4.  One shot fits all?  Why would you give a vaccine to people that have already been exposed and developed anitbodies?",0

thats just from the immune response. your body is working extra hard to produce  antibodies and white cells,0
yeah the mRNA is pretty unstable on its own to start with why the vaccines must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. and immune system will break it down with in few days.,0
how they work some people get bigger immune response. shot 1 hit me like a truck old adage thats how you know its working. i expect number 2 also put my on my ass for few days as well and ill take that over what COVID could do.,0
its 90% effective you wont get sick the last 10% is youll get sick but not AS sick as you would with out it. the mRNA vac's are also showing to work as well  at 80%+ on ALL know mutations right now and again the other 20% of at lest preventing a hospital stay. mRNA is amazing and its imo safer then old style weakened virus vax,0

"A December preprint about SARS-CoV-2, by scientists at Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), produced findings about wild coronavirus that raise questions about how viral RNA operates.  The scientists conducted the analysis because they were “puzzled by the fact that there is a respectable number of people who are testing positive for COVID-19 by PCR long after the infection was gone.”  Their key findings were as follows: SARS-CoV-2 RNAs “can be reverse transcribed in human cells,” “these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed” (a phenomenon called “retro-integration”) — and there are viable cellular pathways to explain how this happens.  According to Ph.D. biochemist and molecular biologist Dr. Doug Corrigan, these important findings (which run contrary to “current biological dogma”) belong to the category of “Things We Were Absolutely and Unequivocally Certain Couldn’t Happen Which Actually Happened.”   SUBSCRIBE to LifeSite's daily headlines Email address SUBSCRIBE U.S. Canada World Catholic The findings of the Harvard and MIT researchers also put the CDC’s assumptions about mRNA vaccines on shakier ground, according to Corrigan. In fact, a month before the Harvard-MIT preprint appeared, Corrigan had already written a blog outlining possible mechanisms and pathways whereby mRNA vaccines could produce the identical phenomenon.  In a second blog post, written after the preprint came out, Corrigan emphasized that the Harvard-MIT findings about coronavirus RNA have major implications for mRNA vaccines — a fact he describes as “the big elephant in the room.” While not claiming that vaccine RNA will necessarily behave in the same way as coronavirus RNA — that is, permanently altering genomic DNA — Corrigan believes that the possibility exists and deserves close scrutiny.  In Corrigan’s view, the preprint’s contribution is that it “validates that this is at least plausible, and most likely probable.”  Reverse transcription As the phrase “reverse transcription” implies, the DNA-to-mRNA pathway is not always a one-way street. Enzymes called reverse transcriptases can also convert RNA into DNA, allowing the latter to be integrated into the DNA in the cell nucleus.  Nor is reverse transcription uncommon. Geneticists report that “Over 40% of mammalian genomes comprise the products of reverse transcription.”  The preliminary evidence cited by the Harvard-MIT researchers indicates that endogenous reverse transcriptase enzymes may facilitate reverse transcription of coronavirus RNAs and trigger their integration into the human genome.  The authors suggest that while the clinical consequences require further study, detrimental effects are a distinct possibility and — depending on the integrated viral fragments’ “insertion sites in the human genome” and an individual’s underlying health status — could include “a more severe immune response … such as a ‘cytokine storm’ or auto-immune reactions.”  In 2012, a study suggested that viral genome integration could “lead to drastic consequences for the host cell, including gene disruption, insertional mutagenesis and cell death.”  Corrigan makes a point of saying that the pathways hypothesized to facilitate retro-integration of viral — or vaccine — RNA into DNA “are not unknown to people who understand molecular biology at a deeper level.”  Even so, the preprint’s discussion of reverse transcription and genome integration elicited a maelstrom of negative comments from readers unwilling to rethink biological dogma, some of whom even advocated for retraction (though preprints are, by definition, unpublished) on the grounds that “conspiracy theorists … will take this paper to ‘proof’ that mRNA vaccines can in fact alter your genetic code.”  More thoughtful readers agreed with Corrigan that the paper raises important questions. For example, one reader stated that confirmatory evidence is lacking “to show that the spike protein only is expressed for a short amount of time (say 1-3 days) after vaccination,” adding, “We think that this is the case, but there is no evidence for that.”  JH Weston Show In fact, just how long the vaccines’ synthetic mRNA — and thus the instructions for cells to keep manufacturing spike protein — persist inside the cells is an open question.  Ordinarily, RNA is a “notoriously fragile” and unstable molecule. According to scientists, “this fragility is true of the mRNA of any living thing, whether it belongs to a plant, bacteria, virus or human.”  But the synthetic mRNA in the COVID vaccines is a different story. In fact, the step that ultimately allowed scientists and vaccine manufacturers to resolve their decades-long mRNA vaccine impasse was when they figured out how to chemically modify mRNA to increase its stability and longevity — in other words, produce RNA “that hangs around in the cell much longer than viral RNA, or even RNA that our cell normally produces for normal protein production.”  It is anyone’s guess what the synthetic mRNA is doing while it is “hanging around,” but Corrigan speculates that its enhanced longevity raises the probability of it “being converted over into DNA.”  Moreover, because the vaccine mRNA is also engineered to be more efficient at being translated into protein, “negative effects could be more frequent and more pronounced with the vaccine when compared to the natural virus.”",1

"I got some confidence in BTC by watching an interview with Lyra.  Her model is not based on the few examples of 4 year cycles, but rather on the rate at which new wallet addresses appear on the blockchain and the nature (size and the behavior of wallets of similar size) of the wallets.  So she models the adoption curve.  He reckons adoption is still in full swing, and her ""moving target"" is currently a price of $300K at end of 2021.  She also mentioned that the $1 trillion market cap is a barrier - that there would be a lot of resistance to falling below $55K.  So I was convinced to start buying BTC again (not much to hodl but trad) If only my friends listened when i first told them about Lyra. My actual portfolio was multiplied by 5 In two months.

@shakey The above video outlines how instructions inside the mRNA trick our cells into creating spike proteins. What he didn't say was that those 'instructions' are actually the spike protein gene from inside the Covid cell .

"@L S I actually do understand this concern, but that ending argument true though. mRNA is EXTREMELY unstable, and barely survives for 24 hours. All it is in the instruct for the body to make the part of the virus that actually attaches to the body, not the actual virus itself (there are inactivated virus vaccines being developed but they haven't been approved yet). So when the virus does actually enter the body, it won't be able to bind and start replicating within the cells.   The spike protein existing on its own with no other parts of SARS-CoV-2 is pratically useless. The ""side-effects"" may be as a result of the ingridents used to deliver the vaccine (the lipid which some may be allergic to), rather than the actual vaccine itself.",0

"@emilgilels and to add to that, mask, or anything covering your breathing through your nose and mouth, is actually cutting off the amount of air intake, and out. Intake reduction, your not getting your normal amount of gasses and oxygen. When you take in less tour body works harder to correct itself. So puts you in a state of panic. As far as your body knows, its being deprived air. So it will put out an alert, and this is constant when wearing a mask. Putting you at more risk when you actually encounter a virus or anything else on top of this threat your bodies already dealing with. So your not gonna get full response, as you would, if no mask. All doctors and common sense tells you not to prohibit breathing. If your at rest your breathing shallow as it is , so to hinder in top of that .,not good.

"@shakey Thanks for your reply.    I think what it comes down to , is that many people are just not convinced that the  synthetic RNA which carries the spike protein gene ( instructions)  will degrade quickly.  But if I accept that it does ,  I can't find any info on how many cells are injected, or how many spike proteins are produced.   I've  heard virologists voice alarm that huge numbers of  spike proteins will be created by the artificial vaccine process.   Yes, the spikes  themselves are useless , but once the cell which produced them begins to die , some of the spike proteins or fragments of them, may be free floating in the body.  If your immune system doesn't catch them all ,  will they eventually lodge in blood vessels, lungs etc causing inflammation ? Already thousands of women are reporting serious problems with their menstrual cycle which is a worry.",0

"The protein cells that create the spike proteins remain protein cells. All infected cells die, hopefully. There have been cases of infected cells ""hiding"" in the body, research ""shingles"". Well, the mRNA only has one purpose, to create spike proteins, when it runs out of RNA instructions, it stops making spike proteins. All spike proteins are destroyed by the immune system. The immune response is normal for the human body. Very unlikely to cause autoimmune disease.",0

"This is an extension of the colorblind analogy for NON-INTERACTIVE ZK Proof:  1) Replace your colorblind friend (the challenger) with a desktop computer. Its screen is described as follows:    * There are 2 buttons: ""prover"" and ""verifier."" You, the prover, must click the ""prover"" button.    * It requires a password. Type anything you like, like ""can_distinguish_red_and_green!"".    * Then the desktop computer will generate a (long) series of stock footages of someone taking the 2 balls, either switching it or not on his/her back, and showing it back to you. Note that you only see the front of the man/woman in the stock footage.    * 3 crucial properties about the desktop computer: (1) same password input, same series output, (2) the series of stock footages is random in a sense that it is ""impossible"" to deduce the password from it (this ""randomness"" prevents you from cheating), and (3) if you just made an incorrect character in inputting the password, the series will change drastically. 2) You list your test answers in a paper like this: ""Switched, Not Switched,  Not Switched, ..."" 3) You broadcast the password and your test answers publicly.  Now for a colorblind person to verify:  1) Everyone has access to the SAME desktop computer. Colorblind person clicks ""verifier"". 2) Person inputs the broadcasted password correctly. 3) Then the desktop computer will generate a (long) series of stock footages of someone taking the 2 balls, bla bla bla... but this time, the person only sees the BACK of the man/woman in the stock footage, so the colorblind person can see if the man/woman switches the balls or not. 4) From the crucial property (1) of the computer, the colorblind person can now verify the broadcasted test answers!  This desktop computer is the analogy for the so-called ""random oracle model"", which is crucial for the security of this protocol.  It's nice if a video is made on this (Part 2?)",0

"@Scott Menard Literally 100s of millions of people (including myself) have been safely wearing masks every day for the last year and not suffering the consequences you mention. There is also no documented notable increase in other germ-based respiratory ailments that supposedly are a danger from wearing masks. There is however a huge amount of evidence that people who are wearing masks (and doing other things like washing their hands properly, practicing social distancing, get vaccinated, etc.) are much less likely to get Covid, which is potential deadly.  The pandemic is a sort of 'natural' experiment about how to respond to the this type of threat. There is strong evidence about what works and what doesn't, and what the real dangers are from.

You don’t know where the mRNA is going or for how long you’ll produce the spike protein. This can have deadly effects in the body, as the real virus only attacks lung cells. The mRNA can attack neurones, kidney cells, spleen cells, etc.. with the real virus you develop strong immunity to the whole virus (the strongest immunity) in about three days. From day six or seven it’s just the body recovering. With the mRNA you can be infected continuously, making it impossible to donate blood for people that need it. Stop promoting this deadly technology! No one needs an RNA or mRNA vaccine for a coronavirus.",0
@Jonathan Electrolux III and wait i just realised you are 67 is that true?,0
Actually this is simplified and accurate at the same time,0
@Dewa Putra Yes I am.,0
@Jonathan Electrolux III okay be safe,0

"This is 2 months later..... Vaccines intent is to give the receiver; a disease, a timed - disease/instant death via who knows in it's content, and/or what we have subsequently learned as DNA altering nanobot technology. (Gene-therapy). Since the illness (covid) has yet to date been 'Isolated', which means 'Proved'...the 'proof' of a 'plague' is non-existent...with it being inconsequential, as the real goal ALWAYS was vaccine passports that control whatever amount of world population  'They' - Globalists deem. (Social Crediting - 'Their'  Great Reset and Fourth Industrial Revolution) All under computer surveillance via the technology induced into our dna.  And THE WORLD thus far is believing it. Now..you are justified in using Isaiah 54:17. Why?. The 'plague' which was/is the lie from without...is now the real plague within, as those who are getting vaccinated become the carriers to everyone around them instead of the other way. So...no 'plague' will come nigh has meaning and purpose as the Word of God to declare and 'stand' on.",0

@TuberMan have you learn cytokine storms? I guess not,0
@TuberMan and you clearly no nothing about mRNA you dont know the history of it nor how it works So you would rather get rna from the virus that is harmfull rather than get a mrna from a vaccine that is so harmless that the chance to get a severe side effect is 1 in a million - 3 million,0

"There is another advantage. Since it only replicates the spike proteins that couple with cell receptors, mRNA vaccine will immunise against all past and future viruses that use the same spike protein and cell receptor combination. E.g. if SARS Cov-1 and MERS-Cov have similar spike proteins and attach to ACE2 receptor, then the mRNA SARS Cov-2 vaccine will offer protection against SARS Cov-1 and MERS Cov, which is not possible with traditional vaccines.",0

@John Doe people are so gullible .. this explanation is so vague and simple its scary ..,0
"people are like oh wow what an easy explanation, my stupid brain can understand it .. fuck .. they dont realise its a synthetic code that makes our rna create spike proteins but how does the body in numerous conditions REACT .. if a certain infection comes in .. and not a covid one .. how can the rna really understand that this bacteria or virus is NOT covid .. will it produce spikes anyway ??",0
that is exactly these critical questions that video does NOT explain .. and people are like oh wow now i understandddd ..,0
and that video is scary because it seems too simple .. our body is complex .. how will the rna message react to a sick body .. diabetes ? other viral infections .. other auto immune diseases ? .. will it disrupt the spike protein creation process? .. will it attack our own cell structure ? will it get confused if another virus or bacteria infects the body .. i dont beleive we can actually trick everybody's rna to pin point ONE specific virus and create spike proteins to fight ONE virus ..,0
if it would be that case .. a lot of helpfull vaccines would have been created .. like for the common flu .. ebola .. other virus's . but apparently they are only created for COVID,0
but they havent been able to create an MRNA vaccine for the common flu .. ebola .. MERS . pneumonia etc .. how come NOW they are creating it for ONE virus astounds me .. and i find it pretty ridiculous,0

This happens to every living being at least once per year, mainly around April/May. Secondly. RNA is essentially what binds your DNA together. When you inject yourself with the mRNA drug, you're telling your DNA to develop antibodies that the body doesn't naturally produce. And because this is developed by human beings, this is pure singularity. In other words, by taking this vaccine − you're denouncing God.",0
Good explanation of Ada,0

simply superb,0
"Excellent mini lecture for non-scientists ! But I heard that once cells in our bodies generate the spike protein following an mRNA vaccine shot, some or all of these proteins are not really excreted and then attacked by the immune system. Instead, these proteins are attacked while they are still attached to the cells that generate them. This could well acount for most side effects, because our immune system actually attacks all the cells with spike proteins still protruding on them. These cells can be endothelial cells lining the inside of alll our blood vessels. This is why some people, if on the more serious side, can have blood clotting. When this happens in the brain, one may have really intense headache. Will this same mechanism do harm to the reproductive system but one does not know this until they want to have babies? However, I hope and still trust with moderate level of confidence that this should be rare, if exists. However, I hope the second shot should have a lower dose to minimize this risk. Lowering the second dose might not lower the protection too much, but will make the vaacination safer.",0

Not sure why this video says that traditional vaccines can give mild symptoms but implies that mRNA vaccines don't . They can both give mild symptoms and often do.

What if someone is controlling the Nodes to take control of the whole chain..? I know it's impossible to do n not easy to do..!!!  Hope its secured more time to time and authenticated and authorised nodes aren't changed or tampered with..!!!,0
"Mining pools are basically workers unions—and they compete with one another. For instance, HiveOS competes with Nicehash currently as well as many other pools to secure Ethereum nodes. These pools are made up of many different individual miners. If a majority of individuals in any particular pool are dissatisfied with the way the pool is being run, they can change pools or force the pool owners to make a change. Seems as though this would actually PREVENT centralization because individuals are given the power to chose which pool to belong to. Proof of work also focuses more computing power on each individuals node(which of course uses more electricity, as you noted), but wouldn’t it also promote higher accuracy of work and increased network security? Proof of stake seems to promote monopolization by whomever has the biggest stick to swing around. Will this not lead to one large mining pool centralizing control and monopoly over every Ethereum transaction moving forward? I could be wrong...I’m just trying to think critically about this.",0

"Can we get an answer to this - this is y main concern. If the cells so vaccinated are never destroyed I am assuming they do die eventually. So the spike protein is not in fact continuously produced right? So really the vaccinated cells produce the spike protein for as long as they are alive which give the immune system enough time to creat antibodies against the virus and this the is like all the other vaccines, in essence. The immune system is now armed to recognize and destroy with antibodies the virus containing this spike on it. As far as auto immune disease...I would think that is possible with any vaccine and any immune system stimulation. I still have no idea which cells are actually so called vaccinated...any cell, T cells only,  B cells only. How long do these cells hang around and produce the spike protein for...if only a couple a weeks enough for body to create antibodies then prob no different from any vaccine BUT if they keep reproducing into more cells which had the mean in them and thus the spike protein is constantly being produced then the immune system is a constant onslaught of this virus and in this hyper state of restimulation my thoughts are that a greater danger for autoimmune problems could occur. There should be a clear answer to this as as you said this is not new technology.",0

"I am happy that you spread knowledge about this energy-intensive wasteful process. Unfortunately, the whole Western world does not seem to care about this environmentally damaging process while voting for green parties and fighting climate change. I am so happy I have discovered the alternatives exist. But they seem to be still marginal without much impact on the mainstream. I wish more people would act responsibly in accordance to their green/leftist/liberal politic preferences. And more media would highlight the problems, promotingenvironmentally friendlier options. How come banks, investment funds etc. are audited and vetted according their green performance but all this stops when the cryptos seem to be an antouchable topic. And the best alternative would be to connect scientific computations like Boinc or World Community Grid to cryptos. But  nobody seems to care in the mainstream..",0

Whag are the scale issues with Ethereum?,0
"I have doubt regarding caching  Consider I have ""cache aside pattern"" and ""in memory cache"" in application server is used. I'm looking for Invalidation logic when there is an update. This was the context.  I read for critical data like password/financial information we use Write Back policy to ensure consistency. In write through one instance's in memory cache entry gets updated and others can remain stale. So, there is inconsistency in write through  My question is same can happen in Write Back, one instance's in memory cache entry gets deleted(invalidated) and we update DB..other instances in memory cache still have that entry. So there is inconsistency in write Back as well? Why do we prefer write back for critical data because same issue is there in write back. If answer is invalidate all instances' in memory cache entry then same can be done for Write through. Which makes me ask question 2.  My another question is : We can update all instances' in memory cache entry and then update DB. In this way consistency is maintained so why not we use Write through for critical data like password financial information?",0

The mRNA gets destroyed inside the cell after the cell produces the spike protein.(that's generally how it works with messenger RNAs)  ""Which cell types end up manufacturing the spike proteins?"" Exactly! And they don't seem like talking about it without having their videos and articles removed or censored or not being ordered in google search results! Disgusting!  ""Do they display this spike protein on their surface, or do they excrete the protein?"" Exactly! According to the scientific and official articles I have read, they appear on the surface of the mRNA-targeted cells. This means those cells can be targeted by any type of viruses that use that specific spike protein to inject its genome to the cell for mass production. Like a channel under the walls of city that can be abused by any enemy who knows that channel. From 5:52 of this video it expresses as if the spike proteins are exerted from the cell!!",0
"""once you have the drivers installed""...What/which drivers??????",0
"Thank you. Please answer these questions:  1. Do we for sure know which cell types end up targeted by the mRNA and manufacturing the spike proteins? If we don't know for at least 99.99% then it is a dangerous method. What if red blood cells, ... become the spike protein factory?!!  2. Are the spike proteins appear on the surface of the mRNA-targeted cells thus get their structure modified, or do such cells completely excrete the protein even from the surface? If (also) on the surface, then it is a dangerous method. This means those modified cells can be targeted by any type of viruses that use that specific spike protein to inject its genome to the cell for mass production. Like a channel under the walls of a city that can be abused by any enemy who knows that channel.  3. If there are mutations in the covid10 virus that modifies or dumps this specific signature spike protein, then all those covid19 injections will be to some extent or completely useless!! Then we have to inject again with a new vaccine and a new spike proteins. I understand that this is multiplicatively benefitial in long term for that sect of the pharma which produces mRNA vaccines.",0

"Yes ,Cheryl the RNA is synthetic. They take the spike producing  gene from inside the virus, and inject it into you inside a package of synthetic RNA. And because RNA  is quite unstable , they wrap it in a coating of nano particles to help deliver it into your cells. Sounds like a recipe for disaster doesn't it?",0
"This is sentence is incorrect: ""But you won't get sick because it's only the spikes not the virus itself."" If the immune system is triggered to produce antibodies by either vaccine virus spikes or the complete virus, the body still can react with viral symptoms. It's the triggering of the immune system that causes inflammation, temperature fluctuations etc. This is how the body naturally responds to a virus. It will do the same with viral spike proteins.",0

"@Cary Francis Hi Cary.   I am aware virus can be isolated, I am aware the SARS COV2 virus was not isolated in any country in the world, there is no proof of isolation to be found in any medical journal. Isolation equals publication, no publication of proof means no isolation.  In order to know that they are dealing with a corona virus, they must isolate the virus and analyze its characteristics, to see if they match the corona viruses or if its a new type of virus.  So if they did not isolate the SARS COV 2(covid 19) virus, how did they get the RNA code of the virus spike protein?  Is this coming from the covid virus RNA or  are they  not using the SARS COV2 virus DNA/RNA at all?  So how did they manage to get or make an RNA to put it in a nanocapsule, without having isolated / analyzed and tested the virus i am curious.",1

Our cells communicate with each other via strands of RNA. Different types of RNA carry different genetic instructions. mRNA specifically is used by ribosomes to make proteins that your body needs at that moment.,0
"Because your body doesn't recognize it. Viruses reproduce by forcing your cells to produce more viruses. So when a cell starts producing something weird, that is a sign there is an infection going on. It will stop producing the protein when it receives new instructions. Your cells send mRNA instructions to each other all the time. And without a new source of mRNA with the spike protein instruction, eventually all the cells will have forgotten.",0
"You do know how viruses work, right? A virus infects a cell and then makes that cell start producing more and more viruses. Each of those viruses was produced by your own body and get destroyed by your immune system.",0
You can't get sick as in there is no active infection. It is just your immune system revving up.,0
"Because Ivermectin isn't effective enough against COVID19. While it is capable of killing SARS-CoV-2 viruses in a laboratory environment, the doses required in a human to clear the infection would be fatal to the human. Like many treatments out there, Ivermectin basically hopes to kill the parasite before it kills the host. With normal parasites, it works well enough. But for a virus, which is much more rugged and will have al ot more material spread throughout the body, Ivermectin just can't get the job done before killing the host.",0
"They feel flu like symptoms. There is a reason practically every disease under the sun can cause flu like symptoms. Those symptoms are your immune system going to work. Fatigue from your body directing all available resources to the immune system. Inflammation from cells rushing to the site of the infection. Reduced appetite because your body doesnt have time to digest food and thus stops asking for food, and if you eat anyway, your body will reject it and cause you to vomit it back up. And fever because viruses and bacteria cannot reproduce as effectively in a hot environment, so your entire body heats up to make the body less hospitable. So yeah, when the vaccine triggers an immune reaction, it will trigger the whole range of symptoms because, as far as your body is concerned, this is a real and serious threat.",0
"The spike proteins are all destroyed. Your antibodies, however, remember. During the ""infection"", your body produces antibodies specifically designed to fight these invaders. When it is successful, memory cells come in and store information on how to reproduce the antibodies in case they are needed again.",0

"@RACHEL Gillespie For a short time your body creates *a* *lot* of the spike proteins the vaccine taught the cells to create.  The body then treats the mass amount of spikes as it would treat any foreign invader in your body.  The virus normally is multiplying out of control by your own infected cells so you get ill for a long time, compared to the relatively controlled creation of spike proteins.  So if you do get flu-like symptoms, they shouldnt last more than a couple days as the body has less work to do, it's still doing the same job, just much quicker.",0

"Does Proof-of-Stake really prevent fraudulent blocks from being entered into the blockchain though?   As far as I know, with Proof-of-Work, the blocks are continually checked, as it is the blocks with the most computing behind them that are trusted. This means that in order to enter false blocks, and keep them there, one would have to give continuously have to compute more than the entire rest of the network combined. Not very practical, though I assume this is why the 51% attack is theoretically possible.   With PoS however, it sounds like it is completely possible for a validator to enter a fraudulent block, so long as they are willing to accept losing the stake they initially put in? Wouldn't that allow a malicious actor to essentially ""buy"" fraudulent blocks on the chain, thus undermining the entire principle that it should be impossible to enter false information into the blockchain?

"Incorrect.  This vaccine set wasn't rushed at all.  mRNA vaccines simply have the ability to be synthesized far more efficiently and effectively as opposed to typical watered down viral loads which then have to be studied and tested for efficacy.  mRNA would seem to do the reverse.  The body is told how to do a thing (the mRNA instruction sets) and then a cell can be exposed to the virus to test.  As opposed to the cell being exposed to the virus and then determining how best to provoke the immune response.  Think of it like this - you know a flood is coming your way.  Your home has the potential to be flooded or be in the path.  Typical vaccines would wait to see the flood before taking any action at all to shore up, and by that time you will suffer greatly as you try to shore up to prevent it from becoming much worse.  mRNA vaccines would have already put up sandbags in preparation, regardless of whether the flood came your way or not.  If the flood did happen your way, you already have the prep set up AND now can shore up even more as needed because you're 10 steps ahead of it.  Some water will get through (see: side effects) but the leakage will be exponentially minimal and easily contained.",0
"Because the vaccines are currently being used to provide specific instructions to the body.  Do this and only this.  The body is being told to create antibodies ahead of an actual infection so that if an actual infection happens, the body is already 10 steps ahead and knows what to look for and what to do when seen.  Unlike typical vaccines which have to first see the infection, interrogate it as it spreads, learn from it, and then provide itself instructions how to combat it.  mRNA takes most of those steps out and keeps you ahead of the infection.  So what long term damage would you expect to see exactly?  Your body is being told told to do one specific thing and one thing only (in this particular instance, watch for Covid then take action immediately).  If you never see the threat, the cells never create the antibodies.  So tell us what long term damage you can possibly expect to see with a vaccine instruction that is potentially never called upon?  If you want to discuss long term effects of a vaccine, I'd be far more concerned with being injected with traditional vaccines which use watered down live loads.  The mRNA doesn't do that - it doesn't give you Covid and then relies on your body to make antibodies.  It only gives your body the instructions on what to do should Covid be seen.  Think of it like a cheat code.  Your body knows what to do before anything actually happens.",0
"If you had actually watched the video, you'd know that the 2% figure was based on a figure between lowest 0.5% and highest at 10% which tracks at a global level, broken down by certain countries.  Some countries have very low mortality of 0.5% and some have as high as 10%.  So they used 2% as the figure for illustration.  2% being a quite common number for mortality in several countries.  They could've used the median number which would've been roughly 5%, but then when they used that 5% figure of the 7.7 Billion population, the number of dead in that scenario would be vastly higher (thanks to how math works) and people would be freaking the fcuk out.  You only need to use a value to demonstrate the casualty rate.  It doesn't have to be a high number because people freak out too easily.  This is why they actually put the ""Worst Case Scenario"" disclaimer at the bottom of that demonstration.",0

@L_C You said it right...,0
mRNA isn't to stable so probably not too long... Fingers crossed for all these guinea pigs who took it ;),0
"and the bracket on the same line with the parentheses and no space, ew",0
"@L S We can be certain that the mRNA will be destroyed after making the ""spikes"" because mRNA is always destroyed after it has done it's job. mRNA has a short lifespan. The tail of the mRNA slowly gets broken down by enzymes within the cell. Once the tail is gone, the mRNA becomes unstable and degrades. mRNA is a simple structure. It cannot enter the nucleus of the cell and it cannot do anything to change DNA. mRNA only has one job and that is to relay it's message to create a protein within the cell's cytoplasm.  As for deaths following the vaccine, The Astrazeneca vaccine has caused deaths because it can cause blood clots. This vaccine is a different type of vaccine that uses parts of the virus itself. I wouldn't recommend the Astrazeneca vaccine because of the deaths associated with it.  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have also been associated with deaths, however it's a little bit different. These vaccines generate a small immune response. That's why some people report feeling sick after receiving one of these vaccines. Even though your body isn't actually being attacked by a virus, your body still thinks it is because of the ""spikes"", so you might get a fever as your body increases its temperature to help fight off these foreign ""spikes"". The deaths following these vaccines typically occur in care homes for the elderly, because some of these people a very vulnerable. The stress of producing a small immune response is enough to contribute to their death. If you are extremely sick, I would advise you don't get the vaccine and stay at home, because if the symptoms associated with the vaccine could kill you, then the actual virus will certainly kill you. It is important for the healthy population to receive the vaccine to stop spreading the virus and eradicate it so that those who could die from the immune generated symptoms of the vaccine don't have to get the vaccine.",0
"Thanks for this video! One thing I didn't understand though is when you say mRNA vaccines won't make you sick. If that's so, why are people feeling very sick after the 2nd Moderna shot?",0
"@The Painted Cynic   Yes, natural mRNA is unstable and breaks down easily , but are you aware that the mRNA in the vaccines is synthetic?    How long does that take to disperse?    And the spike proteins that it tricks the cells into making are not natural either. You won't find free floating spike proteins anywhere in nature and we've just turned our bodies into manufacturers of literally millions of these things. If the immune response which they provoke doesn't destroy them all, where will they lodge in our bodies?  The serious inflammation/clots  caused by this will be  just one of the problems which these vaccines pose.   It is not important that the population gets vaccinated. It has a 99.8% recovery rate , no more serious than a bad flu , and is only dangerous to the frail elderly and others with serious health issues.  As happens every year with the flu.  '  Asymptomatic spread is a concept they just made up last year. Have you heard it used before? Asymptomatic means healthy.  The vaccine  does not prevent you from being inflected or from spreading the virus.  It MAY lessen your symptoms.   Despite what the MSM tell you , there were very few excess deaths last year in the world.  The normal flu,  pneumonia, heart attacks, cancer etc were all rebranded as virus deaths to continue the fear.  We have all been lied to by the govts/media. There was no pandemic - the case numbers were hugely inflated by the use of the now completely discredited PCR test. It is a brilliant device but it is not a diagnostic tool.   You won't hear about that if you only watch MSM.  The payments to hospitals for each case and death meant the numbers of deaths were also inflated.   What did you see with your own eyes in your street , your community, your workplace, which convinced you that there was a devastating sickness around?  Most people don't even know anyone who was sick. In a real pandemic half the people you know would be dead. Society would have broken down completely. Lockdowns and stupid masks would have made no difference at all.  So you have to ask yourself why would they deliberately scare tens of millions of people into thinking they were virus positive, terrify the world into thinking a deadly virus was all around us, waiting to pounce?  The globalists running this scam have an agenda .  The vaccine = vaccine passport = Digital ID = total control by our ''leaders''.   Just like China's Social Credit Score which they've had in place for a decade. Its horrifying.",0

"That is EXACTLY true.  NoSQL is ideal for certain limited limited use cases, but it is very popular because lazy programmers don't need to bother learning SQL or good database design.  And since NoSQL is so ""flexible"" these same lazy developers often end up storing JSON that is inconsistent over time so incredibly hard to work with and maintain long-term.",0
"Wow, that means you're right!",0
"This video is INCREDIBLY INACCURATE.  First, relational databases can scale EXACTLY the same way horizontally across multiple servers as described here if you need that.  Seriously, exactly the same.  But you very rarely see that feature used because well designed relational databases are actually very efficient and rarely ever need multiple servers (except maybe for backup/redundancy).  In fact, businesses usually host many separate relational databases on one server because those databases don't need anywhere near the capabilities of a full server.  In the real world relational databases are as good as everything NoSQL databases can do and vastly better in a lot of ways that NoSQL totally sucks at.  Most business data is by nature relational and thus RDBMS systems are vastly better for almost all normal use cases.  The only time something like NoSQL is actually better is if the data to be stored is not structured.  Which is actually fairly rare.  But good RDBMS like Postgres are excellent at storing relational data AND can actually have individual tables that are NoSQL for the rare cases where you really do need that.  So Postgres can do everything NoSQL can, but NoSQL can't do a lot RDBMS can.  The very critical thing this video does not mention is that for effective, performant NoSQL you must understand ALL THE USE CASES of the data ahead of time and design the data to be stored in NoSQL accordingly.  If you do not then NoSQL is incredibly slow and does not scale.  This is clearly documented in AWS DynamoDB for example.  In practice this means if you design & build a system for certain purposes, and then need to add additional functionality later that could either destroy the performance/scalability or you may have to completely redesign all the data and rewrite much of the code.  A reasonably well designed relational database does not suffer from these problems, if the tables are designed according to the natural (easy to figure out) relationships between the data you can then use that database for pretty much any purpose and get good performance.  This is an incredibly important difference.  NoSQL can be very useful for certain (fairly rare) use cases, but even then usually only part of the data is unstructured and other parts of the data is naturally relational.  The real reason I see most frequently why NoSQL is becoming popular is due to lazy developers who don't know SQL and don't want to bother learning how to design a relational database properly.  NoSQL is most frequently used poorly as an excuse not to do data design up front by developers who don't like working with databases, but as mentioned up-front data design is actually far more important to scale NoSQL which is why a lot of important projects that need long-term support end up being rewritten from NoSQL to RDBMS later on.",0
"As I just detailed in my comment, almost all of the information in this video is highly inaccurate.  They go into great detail about how one can scale data across multiple servers - but that EXACT SAME methodology can be used with RDBMS equally.  It really seems like they had an agenda to claim that NoSQL was better than RDBMS and then set out to say that without bothering to try and be truthful or accurate.",0

My Tesla! haha nice m8,0
"@Rehlani RDBMS has supported this for decades and its not all that difficult.  Needing to obtain and manage multiple servers is far more of a headache than configuring an RDBMS to do this.  This is considered difficult for RDBMS because its almost never necessary.  RDBMS are so damn fast and performant (if you bother to design your tables & indexes decently) that you almost never need multiple servers.  In fact, the vast majority of relational databases in companies are hosted on shared RDBMS servers that host the databases of many different applications simultaneously - without performance issues.  Plus this video glosses over the major data inaccuracy point - that even after you've successfully inserted into a NoSQL system doing a query for that data may return nothing for awhile until all the servers have been able to replicate/sync.  Which ALSO means that if you later update that data in a NoSQL any processes that fetch that record may get the new or the old copy (depending on how far replication has gotten) and there is no way for the application to know if it has current or stale data.  THAT IS HUGE and a potentially massive problem.",0
@Random Schmid Uh-hu.  Except then the developer would be expected to know SQL and understand good data design.  Too much for a lot of lazy devs.,0
"@Siliarus There are actually ways around that.  Various database systems (RDBMS and NoSQL) are actually capable of understanding JSON and allowing queries that use data in the JSON.  So you can run a query that returns all the JSONs that contain orders above $100.  BUT - and this is a big but - having the database server parse though that JSON is slow, vastly slower than performing the same query on an RDBMS that contains the order total in an indexed column.",0
"@Vinny Meller Indexes on JSONB are a pain though and its still generally less performant that querying relational data that has a decent, indexed table structure.",0
"@Adam Cruickshank Google search is an edge case though.  How many databases exist in the world that index that many totally unrelated things?  Um Google, Bing, Facebook.  Situations like that represent probably 0.001% (or less) of all databases in existence.  The vast majority of software developers work for companies and the vast majority of corporate data is naturally relational.  NoSQL is really useful for certain use cases, but those are a rather small percentage of the total.",0
"@Laurent Devigne Lets be honest, most of the people upvoting this are people who don't know SQL nor how to design a database well and for them this video is just more validation that its okay for them to be lazy and not bother learning how to do databases properly.",0
@Adrian Monza Except that relational databases ABSOLUTEY DO scale horizontally.  In fact they can scale horizontally across multiple servers in the exact way described in this video.  Its been possible for decades.  Its just not necessary for 99.99% of use cases because a single RDBMS server is insanely fast and can handle a massive query load if the tables are designed and indexed well.,0
The comments on this video make me very happy.  Lots of people calling out the inaccuracies and bullshit in this video.  Shows that there are still many people out there who actually understand databases and tradeoffs.,0

"@L S It doesn't matter if the mRNA is synthetic or not. In order to be mRNA it has to made of the same basic components and therefore it will breakdown like ""natural"" mRNA.  White blood cells eat all sorts of crap that enters our body. The ""spike"" proteins wont get ""lodged"" anywhere in our bodies. These proteins are essentially the ID card of the virus and anywhere these proteins go they will be identified by cells in our body. Once the body recognizes the ""spike"" protein as an intruder, all the ""spike"" proteins will be destroyed very quickly.  I'm not sure where you got the idea of proteins clotting(?) but that doesn't happen. The worst thing that could happen with a vaccine like this would be if it triggered a cytokine storm, but with the amount of testing that's already been done on it, that's not even an option right now.  Asymptomatic spread is not a new term, you've just never heard it before. The vaccine does stop the spread of viruses. How do you think we've nearly eradicated measles, small pox, and polio? I'm not sure how to argue with you about whether or not covid is real and deadly, because to me it's a fact. Just because it doesn't have a 50% death rate doesn't mean it's not a pandemic. Medical care has come a long way since 100 years ago so this pandemic is obviously not as devastating as previous pandemics because we can at least treat some patients. Without the extensive lockdowns, we would have seen a lot more deaths as hospitals filled up and could no longer treat people. You believe the news sources when they speak of deaths from the vaccine, but you don't believe them when they speak of deaths from the virus. You obviously only see and believe what you WANT to see and believe. As a student nurse, I've literally seen with my own eyes people who could have easily lived another 20-30 years suffocate to death alone in a hospital bed from this virus. I've heard from my colleagues of countless patients who never left the hospital alive from this virus. I honestly don't even know how I can continue on after this. How can I help sick people when they choose holistic or home remedies because they don't believe in medicine and then they die because I couldn't help them? I'm not saying science and the field of medicine is perfect, but it's far better than the remedies of the stone ages.",0

"@The Painted Cynic I find it extraordinary that you are equating the brilliant vaccines for measles,polio etc with this rushed concoction which doesn't even have approval.  Only authorised for emergency use. You know it doesn't stop infection , only lessens your symptoms. And of course I've heard of asymptomatic before, but have you ever heard it in previous bad flu years - Oh you may be asymptomatic  so don't visit grannie?  No, just more fear mongering. To turn those who are vaccinated against those who aren't.  As a student nurse , you would be aware that the vascular nature of this particular virus , meant that HCQ and Ivermectin were having astounding success in early treatment of this illness . Those drugs were banned and smeared across the world because  Bill Gates and the rest of the globalist monsters couldn't get their vaccines authorised if treatment already existed. Doctors in some countries were even threatened with jail if they prescribed it. Those people have blood on their hands.  I'm not saying people didn't die from covid, only that the case numbers were vastly overstated via the PCR test  and illnesses were rebranded to reflect a covid death. I don't where you have the idea that there has been enormous amounts of testing done on these vaccines.  They have tried to get them to work for decades but couldn't, because the animals trials always failed. Only a couple of months  last year doesn't make for exhaustive testing. There has never been a successful mRNA vaccine from any drug company and Moderna has never brought a vaccine to market before.    Don't you find it disturbing that Pfizer's trials last year specifically excluded pregnant women or men who had sexual partners of child bearing age , but now they're yeah it's all okay. Everyone just step right up and get jabbed. Even children ,and you know that they have a 99.998% chance of dying from this thing. It's appalling and I don't how people can ignore those facts and take something so experimental,  and which the drug companies have zero liability for.",0

On the other side, speed is often no issue at all. Hence the Leonardo is still my first pick from the drawer. Arduino IDE use? Well very much in theory, If you like compile-and-upload times of several minutes (so you must LOVE coffee!) go ahead. It might be OK for a final version, not in the concept stage where you do lot of experimenting. Kids in the classroom can only do like 5-10 uploads in a lesson with the ESP32. That brings me by the reason why upload is so slow: the board uploads like 500kB of code. No idea what it contains. Nobody knows. Do we upload the long arm of the Chinese government? Who knows. If you want a good board for educational purposes, my favourite right now must be the micro:bit V2. No WiFi in that, but it has better Bluetooth than the ESP (5.1 vs 4.0). The board is more versatile (LED's, buttons, IMU, microphone, light sensor, speaker), nearly as fast, and most important, it just flies on compile and upload. 5 seconds and you updated your code on it.

"Great artistic videos you have here Mr. SE.  However, what led you to believe proof of stake was first exposed in 2011?  It's incorrect.  Satoshi introduced his own version of PoS in the later versions of the bc white paper.  They all had version numbers up to v11.  And more than 8 citations.  Satoshi intended the first implementation of Bitcoin to have a combined PoW + PoS algorithm.  However the guy that hijacked bc with the overwritten v0.1.x version number releases only had a very early version of the white paper that only mentioned PoW, which was commonly used on several prior digital currencies.  Notice the various email/mailing list subject lines always mention two digit version numbers but the text in the body of the messages and in the file names have 3 digits.  You think a precise computer programmer and speaker like Satoshi would be loosey-goosey with his numeric designators? And no one would ever mention the discrepancy one time in 12 years?  No.  Because there wasn't a version mismatch, because that was produced after the fact by the person Satoshi subcontracted to modernize and manage the codebase between Jan, 2009 and late 2010 when original Satoshi changed all his account passwords and dipped out .. because he came to realize that Satoshi #2 could not be trusted.  Satoshi #2 also conspired somehow to remove the .PDF contract with their real names that Satoshi inserted into that first week's transactions.  That explains the 2 zero difficulty size anomaly.  And what I've seen mysteriously change in just the past two weeks:. The genesis block always had a hash of all zeros.  And block #1 had a height of like 216 blocks.  (I think).    Anyways, I'll bet you that if you calculate the number of blocks that would/should be generated during that missing first week, it would exactly account for the two digit difficulty anomaly.  If there was 2-3 computers mining from Jan 1st or 3rd to the 9th.  If memory serves, the actual genesis block was mined on Jan 1st and had 4 newspaper headlines.  The Jan 3rd block had one headline, and also a binary blob of data that consisted of an encrypted business contract specifying the arrangement between real Satoshi and his fake friend Satoshi #2, with their real names.  I believe that Satoshi had asked Satoshi#2 to implement Bitcoin originally using a perfect requirements/specification doc, but he ""couldn't figure it out"" and gave up.  That week Satoshi #1 said to his GF (Satoshi #3), ""How hard could it be?""  And SN#1 sat down and coded bitcoin-v0.1.exe in 4 days.  That would have been over 1.5 years before Jan 2009.   All will be revealed. Satoshi #1 has compassion and understanding for the bad guys (friends?), and hopes they don't get in trouble.  They know not the error of their ways, and merely forgot that Satoshi#1 always acts to further the best interests of all parties involved.  By being greedy, they lost everything.  By giving everything away, SN#1 manifested everything for everybody forever.  Very ironic.

HIV is like a team of snipers that specifically shoot your commanders. With no commanders, the intelligence reports are useless and the soldiers don't know who or what to act against. They become easy prey for any enemy army.  That is why they say AIDs doesn't kill you. It doesn't. It simply makes it so you die of pneumonia, the flu, the cold, fungal infections, and worse.",0

"You make a big deal about how mining pools are a problem in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, because of how they cause centralization of power. But does proof-of-stake actually solve this problem?  The reason mining pools exist in proof-of-work systems, is that the chance of a solo miner mining a block is tiny. You could run a farm for months and not get a single block. Or you could get lucky. The mining pool turns a lottery into a steady income by aggregating large amount of computing power, and paying out shares of the income of the blocks you mine together.  I don't see any reason the same couldn't happen in a proof-of-stake system, except where many stakeholders come together to pool their stakes, and turn that into a steady income. Similar to investing in a business that pays dividends.  My conclusion is that proof-of-stake by itself doesn't seem to prevent pooling, and in fact, the same incentives seem to be there as with proof-of-work based currencies.

"POS does not solve the energy problem nor the centralization problem it doesnt even solve how to issue the tokens initially in a fair way which is the ultimate source of centralization ( ie ico, dev tax, presale, premine ect ) which is the true innovation of POW mining.",0
"The issue with POS is it doesnt at all solve how to distribute the first initial coins for fair work without a central actor just printing them for themselves thats why every POS coin seems to start with a presale , premine, Dev Tax ect where some group prints themselves free coins for nothing . The solution to the problem of POW and ASICs is the CPU mineable coins which assure much better distribution as anyone could mine with their home computer but also less massive mining farms and more mining on idle or recycled hardware. Its easy to say it would be nice to spawn currency without using energy but if that worked you could just print endless POS coins and have a free energy machine not so eith POW because the adjusting cost of energy and if we mine with useful computers we benefit from the network ifrastructure ( better computers for everyone ) One such coin is Monero",0
perfecto!,0
People will tell you that POS coins reward you for staking but the reality is they punish you for not staking by diluting users that dont participate in the mining. With a POW you could just hold it and you have the best passive mutually beneficial strategy not so with POS where if you dont actively stake ( hope you dont go into coma or any handicap that keeps you from staking your coins ) you get diluted by stakers. If your dad you gave ETH to isnt in the know and he forgets to stake eth 2.0 well hes SOL and his stake will be dilluted. If he holds a POW coin he doesnt have to mine or stake he can just be passive and benefit thats why POS is imferior,0
"The solution to keeping POW, reducing centralization and the issue of specialized hardware are solved by cpu mineable coins like Monero which allow people to mine on their home computers making use of idle cpus and existing or recycled hardware instead of massive mining farms in one place.",0
Thsats not a good thing if only people who own the coin can mine based on what they already own like who gets the first coins.. POS does not solve how to fairly distribute the initial coins only how to keep it going and thats like the main problem. If people can issue money for 0 energy how can they extract any energy without either breaking physics 2nd law or the fundamental economic arguments break down.,0
People as in real dictators are actually trying this slowly but surely,0
XRP is created for 0 energy spawned from nothing no POW so expect to get that back out.,1
lol you cant use any of it before you buy the coins which is silly and outright sketchy you can mine Monero today with your CPU and verify everything and ypull never be asked to buy before you can mine which is why POS is really dangerous.,0
@Mix Wood unless they have large shorts in place on a futures market,0
They will succeed with POS much faster than POW,0
No dude Pi isnt mining they just spawned a bunch of erc20 tokens ( airmiles ) and they give them to people for clicking on ads and spamming their friends dude its not mining at all by any standard,0
The reason you cant spawn money with 0 energy and expect to get energy out is basic physics its so dangerous to say its secure when theres no mechanism whatsoever to distribute the first initial coins fairly so most POS coims are literally spawned from nothing for free to the benefot of the creator group very much not unlike airmiles,0
"I don't understand why you brush over the exchange of public keys, when you made a point to mention that the exchange of symmetric keys can be intercepted.

no because you first need to coin before you can participste which is dumb,0
I agree it makes no sense POS doesnt even deal with how to distribute the initial coins. The leader of a dictatorship could print themselves all the coins in a POS framework and use POS to run it but the dictator gets all the money and control while the users have to verify the blocks or be dilluted and thats a very common way of using POS its really not secure or decentralized. Who cares about a 51% attack if the creators spawned all the coins for themselves for free thats basically an attack at the outset.,0
It is and POS is like hacked from the outset because the creators often give themselves all the stake..,0
Cardano is garbage,0
Not only that think about it who gets the first coins in POS ? theres no mechanism to fairly distribute the first coins like in POW so in most cases the creators issue themselves and people that pay them all the first coins and then they get cement their monopoly by using staking to make it impossible for others to mine any significant amount.,0

"How do you determine fraudulent transactions, when you only have one validator responsible for checking? There would have to be others also checking to ensure the validator wasn't passing a fraudulent transaction. And depending on how many steps you have in validating the validators work, you could be spending a lot of energy there too. Maybe the solution would be to randomly select one high stake and one low stake validator for each block. It would drastically reduce the odds of a fraudulent transaction passing, because if the two validators returned different answers you know one of them is wrong and no reward is distributed at that time. At that point it would probably trigger a backup pair of one high one low stake validator, and if both of them get the same answer and it matches one of the original validators, then the original validator who had the right answer can get their reward, the one who returned a wrong answer gets a penalty, and the two backups split the reward and penalty from the one who had a wrong answer (so probably less than being a first-round validator who got it right, but still enough to make it worthwhile). And if the backup validators don't agree on the answer, or they agree but it doesn't match either of the originals, then it's likely a fraudulent transaction that should be stopped. This system wouldn't be as efficient as a single validator per calculation system, but would be a lot more efficient than proof-of-work, it would be a lot more secure and reliable than single validator, and it would also give lower stake individuals the ability to be involved and earn rewards too. And having one high stake plus one low stake involved in every transaction, it can work a bit like a system of checks and balances",0
"@rlui123 NoSQL would be a terrible choice for streaming very large media files.  That is massively inefficient in regards to RAM, I/O , etc.  You want those kinds of files stored on disk.  Period.  Disk allows for efficient random access in blocks which is what you want for an efficient streaming implementation.  Building a streaming system that pulled from NoSQL would have crippling limitations and horrible scalability.  But once again SQL is vastly better for this than NoSQL as well, because some RDBMS (such as Microsoft SQL Server) can actually be configured to store all the blobs for certain tables as disk files, allowing direct access to the data via normal file I/O.  I probably would still not use this unless there was a reasonably small number of total media files (maybe a few thousand max).",0
Can you provide your personal mail id?,0
"@Me Myself I NoSQL is ""bare metal"", it's fast because it simply provides links to actual media files. The links are reference to media such as .mp4 files that automatically stream in HTML5 player. It doesn't get simpler than that, there is no overhead compared to SQL.",0
"@rlui123 That makes zero sense.  It is not bare metal.  I've written pure machine code, assembly language and coded for hardware directly - that is bare metal.  What do you mean it provides ""links to ... media files""?  So it doesn't store the large, multi-gigabyte media file itself but instead stores a URL or whatever reference to a file stored elsewhere?  Is that what you're saying?  If so, then this invalidates what you said in your prior message when you were talking about NoSQL storing multi-gigabyte files.  If the files aren't being stored in the database then the size of the files is utterly meaningless and you put emphasis on big file sizes.  Also, a SQL RDBMS can store ""links"" to files (URLs or whatever) just as well and maybe even better than a NoSQL database.  That's very unlikely to be a good use case for NoSQL.",0

"​@Thomas Lecky In theory yes. When two different inputs produce the same output, we call it a hash collision. However, a good hashing algorithm makes sure that it's really hard to trigger these collisions at will. Over time, hash functions become less secure (flaws are discovered and computers get faster) and so blockchains will definitely have to switch hash functions at some point in the future.",0

There's no fancy algorithm to try and detect fraud (like what regular banks try to do). A blockchain only cares about if you're the owner of a wallet and if it has sufficient funds to make the transaction.

"1) flu viruses belong to the family of viruses called “adenoviruses” 2) every flu season (average 3 times a year) the several adenovirus’ population in any geographical area undergo a process called GENETIC SHIFT and GENETIC DRIFT which is responsible for creating variants like H1N1, H7N1 etc. You can find videos explaining genetic shift and genetic drift in common flu adnenoviruses. In a nutshell, the genome of the virus CROSS HYBRIDIZES (not mutate) with other variants atleast 3 times a year. This does not mean that it becomes more deadly.  Imagine 3 different kinds of puzzles and they all have 100 pieces each, but you can fit 1 piece from puzzle 1 into puzzle 3, and 15 pieces of puzzle 2 into puzzle 3. The final complete pictures of the puzzles will look “abnormal” but the pieces will fit perfectly, that’s what’s happening with adenoviral genomes.  As a result, such vaccines cant be made fast enough when genetic shift and genetic drift happens 3 times a year. By the time a vaccine is developed the dominant strain in a geographical area cross hybridizes into something else. Hope this was clear.",0

Is it true that cardano doesn't have smart contracts?,0
Thanks for this content is very usefull!. Just one question. I don't get very well why just adding the nonce to the sha256 function adds the same amount of 0s that has being set in the difficulty property.

"In a nutshell, the immune system will ""forget"" to fight off infections that it hasn't seen in a long time.",0
It's indeed like you say: we simply increment the nonce until the right hash is found (you could also use random values). Why do we do it like that? The output of a (good) hash function cannot be predicted or steered towards a certain form. So we just keep trying to add random data until we find a hash that matches the difficulty requirement.,0
"For now, yes. But they've just launched the Alonzo test net which does include support for smart contracts.

"POS OR POW, which is more censorship and control-resistant? Some questions I note: 1. Does hashing power in the PoW model mean more security layers? 2. PoS is less immutable given that its coding for verification is less layered (above), it seems, somehow. Given the simple energy comparison, it is difficult for me to believe PoS is better than PoW unless I learn much more about it. Any mechanism of punishment in the PoS model means a rejection of data. It is not a good indicator, even though I don't know Inter-planetary file systems enough to draw a conclusion from PoS deployed in IPFS. The punishment model simply indicates deliberate right or wrong, or simplification. It does not lower the incentive, instead or increase it - it directly punishes. How far is this true? 2.5. The theory for punishment, timeless or updateless, or proactive, whatever the name, seems to be flawed. 3. The early-adopter Ponzi risk is huge with PoS, it seems.",0

"Dead things still have DNA for a long time. Sure, it eventually decays. But the longevity is way better than hard drives.",0
"@Harish Kumar Gujudhur No hashing does not mean PoW in PoS model. In PoW, you have to do tons of hashes on the same block again and again only modifying its nonce until the hash result matches a specific contract. It requires a lot of tries to find a valid nonce and these tries take time and energy. In case of PoS as explained above, you would only have to hash once per validator to determine the next validator. Easy task, even if there are many validators. No competition, no need for gigantic mining farms.  To do a 51% attack on bitcoin you need half of the hashing computing power (that means only the 4 biggest bitcoin mining pools). To do a 51% on a PoS currency, you typically need 51% of the coins. Some people think that if you own 51% of a currency, you won't attack it because the currency will lose its value and you will lose all your investments. So PoS should be a lot less targeted by 51% attacks.",0
@Angel Gutierrez The dollar has value cuz the US government forces us to value it by accepting taxes only in dollars. Simple as that.,0
"That is actually not true. The difference between a pyramid scheme and proof of stake, is that in a pyramid scheme you get paid if more people buy into the scheme. In contrast, proof of stake rewards stake pools for their work (validating transactions). If they do a bad job or try to do something malisious their stake gets cut. So they are incentiviced to do a good job. The whole thing takes another form, when delegators are brought into the table. I actually made a video about this if you are interested :)",0
"@rt1517 Thank you very much. I'm currently leaning on PoW. So, feasibility-wise you mean PoS is less secure, but in terms of the desire to take the 51% attack potential, PoW has a higher competition. (excluding less popular PoW coins not targeted as Store of Value) Based on your explanation concerning the need for gigantic mining farms so far, it has a higher energy demand for attacks than PoS.",0

"@rt1517 Also, I would be really grateful if you would point out what other consensus algorithms use more than one hashing to check for a valid nonce.

"@Harish Kumar Gujudhur I would say that PoS is often more secure. Yes performing a 51% attack on bitcoin would be very difficult as you need a lot of power. But it would be not as hard as owning 51% of the Bitcoins which would cost something like 250,000,000,000$. And if you have 250,000,000,000$ of bitcoins, I bet you will not attack the currency...

"1) The virus is mutating, but those, who have designed this jab, are putting their faith into the spike protein, which is similar to all the variants of 'rona and therefore, should work theoretically; 2) AFAIK, Pfizer had legal immunity until at least 2024, not so sure about AZ, Moderna and J&J though; 3) There probably will be, but later.

@Simply Explained do u agree with the spike being harmful to our body and gets into blood circulation theory,0

I'm sorry I haven't found this channel before. Thank you for the content,0
"Thank goodness then that theoretically if one has had corona naturally one should be immune against the mutations (according to vaccines). And since this corona is super infectious (according to the ""experts"") most have likely allready had it.   And considering the low deathrate of this 'ronavirus and the rise of deaths in most countries when vaccinations started. One is more likely to survive it naturally, then from the expirimental jab that will probably have some ""unforseen"" side effects later.  Thanks for your answer before.",0

Also these Covid vaccines have many more side effects compared to the traditional ones, at least one order of magnitude more (as seen in active vaccine vigilance in clinical trials).",0

"@Anne-Liv Gamlem there's also reports of heart swelling, brain swelling, blindness, deafness, soreness, tons of people got the Corona virus after fully vaccinated, there are over 200,000 reports of different symptoms and over 4800 deaths so far. There are so many reports that the cdc said they just aren't going to update the vaers system anymore. I tried pulling data from the vaers system but I can't get the results down under 10,000 to see the results. There have been 174 million positive cases and 89% have survived. Only 0.047% of the world's population has passed from the virus, and that number includes gunshot deaths labeled as covid, car accidents labeled as covid, drug overdoses/suicides labeled covid so it's probably about half of that number. Also, if you have had covid, you have antibodies and do not need a vaccine. People who got bird flu still have antibodies from that so it is likely you will have the antibodies for the rest of your life. 18 - 55 year olds that are healthy will be OK, 18 and under are almost immune showing little to no symptoms. But the TV told you you needed it so take it and hope for the best.

This ENTIRE covid scam could be a CONTROLLED PANDEMIC (like the “controlled opposition”) to scare people into taking the ""vaccine"" FIRST (actually ANTIDOTE, NOT VACCINE). THEN, “CONVINCE” the people THROUGH MORE FEAR TACTICS they need a STEADY, CONSTANT SUPPLY OF THE ANTIDOTE BECAUSE OF THE ""MUTATIONS"", real or not but spread it is real.

THE ANTIDOTE FOR COVID19 WAS ALREADY MADE, WHEN THEY RELEASED COVID19 BUT THEY HAD TO MAINTAIN THE CHARADE THAT THEY WERE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO GET A VACCINE FOR IT.   LO BEHOLD, THESE BASTARD, DANGEREOUS TO MANKIND ENTITIES DIDN'T COME UP WITH ONE ""VACCINE"", THEY MADE SIX OF THEM IN LESS THAN A YEAR! A TOTAL IMPOSSIBILITY! ANY VIROLOGIST WILL TELL YOU TO MAKE A VACCINE IT REQUIRES 10-20 YEARS!   ANTIDOTES ARE EASY TO MAKE, COMPARED TO VACCINES, BECAUSE YOU MAKE THE ANTIDOTE FOR WHAT YOU ALREADY MADE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MADE, YOU KNOW THE INGREDIENTS IN IT AND YOU MAKE THE OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH NEUTRALIZES WHAT YOU MADE ALREADY IN THE FIRST PLACE, WHICH IS THE ARTIFICIAL, MANUFACTURED, MAN MADE BIOLOGICAL WEAPON. IN THIS CASE COVID19, WHICH IS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON, FOR THE PURPOSE TO MAKE STEADY FLOW OF MONEY FOR THEM, THROUGH THEIR ANTIDOTES THEY CALL “VACCINES”. A LOT BETTER MONEY MAKER THAN THE ""ILLEGAL"" DRUG BUSINESS! THIS IS THE ""LEGAL"" DRUG BUSINESS IN ACTION! LATER ON, THEY SIMPLY REPLACE THE ANTIDOTES WITH SALINE SOLUTION IN ORDER TO RAKE IN MORE MONEY FOR THEMSELVES. THESE ENTITIES ARE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING! ANYTHING!

You are regurgitating the product claims. Like all products, claims are made. And you hear the good stuff. I like you to be right. Dont get me wrong. But why not the WHO , mRNA companies step forward and announce officially? What they think need not be what will be in future. You are just basing on what they claim.

Most vaccines have undergone 5-10 year long studies to determine that.  What's telling is that around 50% of medical professionals are declining the vaccine.

"They are digital deeds. They are worthless unless backed up with some sort of right, such as the copyright. It's like owning a home, minus being able to live in it. NFTs are a great way to sign a document and the technology will be useful, however owning for the sake of owning is not going to pan out economically. With physical works of art, the owner keeps the rare original and shows it at galleries, or lends it to other galleries, and there is the risk of loss. The speculation end of the economic value of the painting can be extended centuries. If Mona Lisa existed as a digital work of art, there would be none of that. People would not fly to Paris to see it in person. They'd google it. That dilutes the value of even the most premium works of art ever made. As a technology, NFTs will be very useful. But they don't magically make something worth millions any more than your house is worth millions simply because the deed is written on really super-duper cryptographically secure and good paper. If a copyright came with an NFT, then you'd have something to give it value. Otherwise you could just as well sell NFTs on the word ""the"" and become a trillionaire.",0

"@Francesco 1000% true. And moreover, there's absolutely cases where spending millions with an underlying NFT makes perfect sense. For instance corporate shares based on NFTs would make a lot of sense. However, anyone could have written a legal contract before NFTs. The thinking that because it's cryptographically secure doesn't make NFTs worth millions. The question is, is a **meme** worth millions? Is it worth millions without copyrights or reproduction rights attached to it? NFTs are a tool to secure data, not where the value actually is. No one looks at the deed to a house as the thing that contains value. It's the house that has value. A deed to a house that burned to the ground is still a valid deed, and NFTs are the same. They aren't the thing you ""invest"" in. The deed and an NFT just assigns it to someone. If you're going to invest in speculation on ""NFTs"" you're really not getting what they are. It's like saying ""I'm going to invest millions on a legal contract!"" So set aside for the moment the fact that NFTs exist, and instead write a legally-binding contract to sell a meme from person A to person B, and include in it a clause that it is excepting therefrom all copyrights and reproduction rights, and record it with a court or office of records. What would that contract be worth? If that changes the economic equation in your head, it shouldn't. It's absolutely 100% identical. The change from a recorded document to an NFT is not a massive change from before. But I suspect people see the word crypto and think it's the next Bitcoin. It is not. NFTs and Bitcoin are totally different things. As time goes on, people will understand what they are (and aren't) and things like memes will find a fair market value, and market values go up, and down as well. Meme's ownership secured by NFTs have all the characteristics of a future value less than present. If there's an argument to be made, it's why a meme is valuable to own. NFTs are not a reason.",0
Owning a meme is stupid. NFTs themselves are not stupid. It's just a really secure signature. Some people think they're magic.,0
"I must say Bitcoin’s price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin’s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why it’s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Mr jeff Anderson. He is always one step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me from making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 5.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy. You can easily get contact of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM @jeffcryptos",1
"@Ryan McGowan ur right about what all that you said 100% but the only reason NFT are super expensive now bec the NFT, specially the ones that are worth millions are created a long time ago when ETH is still cheap. the reason they are so expensive now bec ETH has skyrocketed its value. and the people that are buying these ridiculous prices of NFT's are just the same wealthy ETH  people who maybe wanted to add more NFT's on their collection",0

Health authorities do not often report the negative effects, but out of people I know who have had the vaccine, approximately 2 out of 3 aren't benefitting positively from the vaccines.

"@Tall Tree The autopsy reports revealed COVID-19 patients were suffering from huge amounts of thick, coagulated blood, and dysfunctional blood vessels were tearing through body tissue instead of repairing it—highly uncommon side effects of respiratory diseases. “Other proteins that have RGD are known to cause complications.

The spike protein in Corona virus causes blood thickening and lung damage, the vaccine uses the same spike proteins from coronavirus and from another virus in chimpanzees.
